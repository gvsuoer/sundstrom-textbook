<p>With the exception of <a href="S_reviewproofs.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.6: Review of Proof Methods">SectionÂ 3.6</a>, each section has exactly two beginning activities. These activities should be completed by the students prior to the classroom discussion of the section. The purpose of the beginning activities is to prepare students to participate in the classroom discussion of the section. Some of these activities will review prior mathematical work that is necessary for the new section. This prior work may contain material from previous mathematical courses or it may contain  material covered earlier in this text. Other beginning activities will introduce new concepts and definitions that will be used when that section is discussed in class.</p>
