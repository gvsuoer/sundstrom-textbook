      The relation <m>R</m>:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Is not reflexive since <m>(c, c) \notin R</m> and <m>(d, d) \notin R</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Is symmetric.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Is not transitive.
            For example, <m>(c, a) \in R</m>,
            <m>(a, c) \in R</m>, but <m>(c, c) \notin R</m>.

    <ul>

        <p>
          Proof that the relation <m>\sim</m> is symmetric: Let
          <m>a,
          b \in \Q</m> and assume that <m>a \sim b</m>.
          This means that <m>a - b \in \Z</m>.
          Therefore, <m>-(a - b) \in \Z</m> and this means that <m>b - a \in \Z</m>,
          and hence, <m>b \sim a</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Proof that the relation <m>\sim</m> is transitive: Let
          <m>a,
          b, c \in \Q</m> and assume that <m>a \sim b</m> and <m>b \sim c</m>.
          This means that <m>a - b \in \Z</m> and that <m>b - c \in \Z</m>.
          Therefore, <m>\left((a - b) + (b - c) \right) \in \Z</m> and this means that <m>a - c \in \Z</m>,
          and hence, <m>a \sim c</m>.

      The relation <m>\approx</m> is reflexive on
      <m>\mathcal{P}\left( U \right)</m> since for all <m>A \in \mathcal{P}\left( U \right)</m>,
      <m>\card(A) = \card(A)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relation <m>\approx</m> is symmetric since for all <m>A, B \in \mathcal{P}\left( U \right)</m>,
      if <m>\card(A) = \card(B)</m>,
      then using the fact that equality on <m>\Z</m> is symmetric,
      we conclude that <m>\card(B) = \card(A)</m>.
      That is, if <m>A</m> has the same number of elements as <m>B</m>,
      then <m>B</m> has the same number of elements as <m>A</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relation <m>\approx</m> is transitive since for all <m>A, B, C \in \mathcal{P}\left( U \right)</m>,
      if <m>\card(A) = \card(B)</m> and <m>\card(B) = \card(C)</m>,
      then using the fact that equality on <m>\Z</m> is transitive,
      we conclude that <m>\card(A) = \card(C)</m>.
      That is, if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same number of elements and <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> have the same number of elements,
      then <m>A</m> and <m>C</m> have the same number of elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, the relation <m>\approx</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>\mathcal{P}\left( U \right)</m>.
