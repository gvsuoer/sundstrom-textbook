<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Some Function Terminology with an Example.</span></h4>. <p>When we have a function <span class="process-math">\(f \colon A \to B\text{,}\)</span> we often write <span class="process-math">\(y = f(x)\text{.}\)</span> In this case, we consider <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to be an unspecified object that can be chosen from the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> and we would say that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is the <dfn class="terminology">independent variable</dfn> of the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is the <dfn class="terminology">dependent variable</dfn> of the function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>For a specific example, consider the function <span class="process-math">\(g \x \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(g( x )\)</span> is defined by the formula</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
g( x ) = x^2  - 2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Note that this is indeed a function since given any input <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in the domain, <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{,}\)</span> there is exactly one output <span class="process-math">\(g( x )\)</span> in the codomain, <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{.}\)</span> For example,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
g( { - 2} ) \amp = \left( { - 2} \right)^2  - 2 = 2,\\
g( 5 ) \amp = 5^2  - 2 = 23,\\
g( {\sqrt 2 } ) \amp = \left( {\sqrt 2 } \right)^2  - 2 = 0,\\
g( { - \sqrt 2 } ) \amp = \left( { - \sqrt 2 } \right)^2  - 2 = 0\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">So we say that the image of <span class="process-math">\(-2\)</span> under <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is 2, the image of 5 under <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is 23, and so on.</p>
<p>Notice in this case that the number 0 in the codomain has two preimages, <span class="process-math">\(- \sqrt 2 \text{ and } \sqrt 2\text{.}\)</span> This does not violate the mathematical definition of a function since the definition only states that each input must produce one and only one output. That is, each element of the domain has exactly one image in the codomain. Nowhere does the definition stipulate that two different inputs must produce different outputs.</p>
<p>Finding the preimages of an element in the codomain can sometimes be difficult. In general, if <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is in the codomain, to find its preimages, we need to ask, “For which values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in the domain will we have <span class="process-math">\(y = g( x )\text{?}\)</span>” For example, for the function <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> to find the preimages of 5, we need to find all <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(g( x ) = 5\text{.}\)</span> In this case, since <span class="process-math">\(g( x ) = x^2  - 2\text{,}\)</span> we can do this by solving the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x^2  - 2 = 5\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The solutions of this equation are <span class="process-math">\(- \sqrt 7\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt 7\text{.}\)</span> So for the function <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> the preimages of 5 are <span class="process-math">\(- \sqrt 7\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt 7\text{.}\)</span> We often use set notation for this and say that the set of preimages of 5 for the function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\left\{ -\sqrt{7}, \sqrt{7} \right\}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Also notice that for this function, not every element in the codomain has a preimage. For example, there is no input <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(g\left( x \right) = - 3\text{.}\)</span> This is true since for all real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x^2 \geq 0\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(x^2 - 2 \geq - 2\text{.}\)</span> This means that for all <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(g\left( x \right) \geq - 2\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Finally, note that we introduced the function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> with the sentence, “Consider the function <span class="process-math">\(g\x \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(g( x )\)</span> is defined by the formula <span class="process-math">\(g( x ) = x^2 - 2\text{.}\)</span>” This is one correct way to do this, but we will frequently shorten this to, “Let <span class="process-math">\(g\x \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> be defined by <span class="process-math">\(g( x ) = x^2 - 2\)</span>”, or “Let <span class="process-math">\(g\x \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(g( x ) = x^2 - 2\text{.}\)</span>”</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="S_introfunctions.html#functionterms" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
