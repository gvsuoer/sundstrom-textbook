<p>Every writer should have a clear idea of the intended audience for a piece of writing. In that way, the writer can give the right amount of information at the proper level of sophistication to communicate effectively. This is especially true for mathematical writing. For example, if a mathematician is writing a solution to a textbook problem for a solutions manual for instructors, the writing would be brief with many details omitted. However, if the writing was for a students' solution manual, more details would be included.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_directproof.html#writing_know" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
