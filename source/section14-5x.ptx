        <p>
          This proposition is false.
          A counterexample is <m>a = 2</m> and <m>b = 1</m>.
          For these values,
          <m>\left( {a + b} \right)^2 = 9</m> and <m>a^2 + b^2 = 5</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          This proposition is true,
          as we can see by using <m>x = 3</m> and <m>y = 7</m>.
          We could also use <m>x = -2</m> and <m>y = 9</m>.
          There are many other possible choices for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          This proposition appears to be true.
          Anytime we use an example where <m>x</m> is an even integer,
          the number <m>x^2</m> is an even integer.
          However, we cannot claim that this is true based on examples since we cannot list all of the examples where <m>x</m> is an even integer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          This proposition appears to be true.
          Anytime we use an example where <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both integers,
          the number <m>x \cdot y</m> is an odd integer.
          However, we cannot claim that this is true based on examples since we cannot list all of the examples where both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are odd integers.

            <p>
              This does not mean the conditional statement is false since when <m>x = -3</m>,
              the hypothesis is false,
              and the only time a conditional statement is false is when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              This does not mean the conditional statment is true since we have not checked all positive real numbers,
              only the one where <m>x = 4</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              All examples should indicate that the conditional statement is true.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The number <m>\left( n^2 - n + 41 \right)</m> will be a prime number for all examples of <m>n</m> that are less than 41.
          However, when <m>n = 41</m>, we get
          <md>
            <mrow>n^2  - n + 41 \amp = 41^2  - 41 + 41</mrow>
            <mrow>n^2  - n + 41 \amp = 41^2</mrow>
          </md>
          So in the case where  <m>n = 41</m>,
          the hypothesis is true  (41 is a positive integer) and the conclusion is false <m>\left( {41^2 \text{ is not prime } } \right)</m>.
          Therefore, 41 is a counterexample that shows the conditional statement is false.
          There are other counterexamples
          (such as <m>n = 42</m>, <m>n = 45</m>, and  <m>n = 50</m>),
          but only one counterexample is needed to prove that the statement is false.
