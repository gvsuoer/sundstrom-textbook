<p>Now suppose that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is false and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true or that it is raining and Daisy is riding her bike. Did I make a false statement by stating that if it is not raining, then Daisy is riding her bike? The key is that I did not make any statement about what would happen if it was raining, and so I did not tell a lie. So we consider the conditional statement, “If it is not raining, then Daisy is riding her bike,” to be true in the case where it is raining and Daisy is riding her bike.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1prop.html#li-49" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
