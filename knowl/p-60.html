<p>Explorations and activities are included at the end of the exercises of each section. These activities can be done individually or in a collaborative learning setting, where students work in groups to brainstorm, make conjectures, test each other's ideas, reach consensus, and, it is hoped, develop sound mathematical arguments to support their work. These activities can also be assigned as homework in addition to the other exercises at the end of each section.</p>
