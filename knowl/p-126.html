<p>In mathematics, we often establish that a statement is true by writing a mathematical proof. To establish that a statement is false, we often find a so-called counterexample. (These ideas will be explored later in this chapter.) So mathematicians must be able to discover and construct proofs. In addition, once the discovery has been made, the mathematician must be able to communicate this discovery to others who speak the language of mathematics. We will be dealing with these ideas throughout the text.</p>
