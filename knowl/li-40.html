<p><em class="emphasis">Constructing appropriate examples is extremely important</em>. Exploration often requires looking at lots of examples. In this way, we can gather information that provides evidence that a statement is true, or we might find an example that shows the statement is false. This type of example is called a <dfn class="terminology">counterexample</dfn>.</p>
<p>For example, if someone makes the conjecture that <span class="process-math">\(\sin \! \left(2x \right) = 2 \sin (x)\text{,}\)</span> for all real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> we can test this conjecture by substituting specific values for <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> One way to do this is to choose values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(\sin (x)\)</span> is known. Using <span class="process-math">\(x = \dfrac{\pi}{4}\text{,}\)</span> we see that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}\sin \! \left( 2 \left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right) \right) \amp = \sin 
\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1, \text{ and }  \\ 2 \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \amp = 
2 \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2}. \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since <span class="process-math">\(1 \ne \sqrt{2}\text{,}\)</span> these calculations show that this conjecture is false. However, if we do not find a counterexample for a conjecture, we usually cannot claim the conjecture is true. The best we can say is that our examples indicate the conjecture is true. As an example, consider the conjecture that <blockquote class="blockquote">If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are odd integers, then <span class="process-math">\(x + y\)</span> is an even integer.</blockquote> We can do lots of calculations, such as <span class="process-math">\(3 + 7 = 10\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5 + 11 = 16\text{,}\)</span> and find that every time we add two odd integers, the sum is an even integer. However, it is not possible to test every pair of odd integers, and so we can only say that the conjecture appears to be true. (We will prove that this statement is true in the next section.)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1prop.html#li-40" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
