<p>The points <span class="process-math">\((x, y)\)</span> in the relation <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> are the points on the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = x^2\)</span> or are in the shaded region. This because for these points, <span class="process-math">\(y \geq x^2\text{.}\)</span> One of the shortcomings of this type of graph is that the graph of the equation and the shaded region are actually unbounded and so we can never show the entire graph of this relation. However, it does allow us to see that the points in this relation are either on the parabola defined by the equation <span class="process-math">\(y = x^2\)</span> or are “inside” the parabola.</p>
