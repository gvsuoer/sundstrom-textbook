<p>The inductive step in a proof by induction is to prove that if one statement in this infinite list of statements is true, then the next statement in the list must be true. Now imagine that each statement in equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_5g.html" title="Equation 29">(29)</a> is a domino in a chain of dominoes. When we prove the inductive step, we are proving that if one domino is knocked over, then it will knock over the next one in the chain. Even if the dominoes are set up so that when one falls, the next one will fall, no dominoes will fall unless we start by knocking one over. This is why we need the basis step in an induction proof. The basis step guarantees that we knock over the first domino. The inductive step, then, guarantees that all dominoes after the first one will also fall.</p>
