<p><a href="C_functions.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 6: Functions">ChapterÂ 6</a> provides a thorough study of functions. Functions are studied before relations in order to begin with the more specific notion with which students have some familiarity and move toward the more general notion of a relation. The concept of a function is reviewed but with attention paid to being precise with terminology and is then extended to the general definition of a function. Various proof techniques are employed in the study of injections, surjections, composition of functions, inverses of functions, and functions acting on sets.</p>
