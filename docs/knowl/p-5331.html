<p>Given nonzero integers \(a\) and \(b\text{,}\) we have seen that it is possible to use the Euclidean Algorithm to write their greatest common divisor as a linear combination of \(a\) and \(b\text{.}\) We have also seen that this can sometimes be a tedious, time-consuming process, which is why people have programmed computers to do this. Fortunately, in many proofs of number theory results, we do not actually have to construct this linear combination since simply knowing that it exists can be useful in proving results. This will be illustrated in the proof of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_relativelyprimeprop.html" title="Theorem 8.14">Theorem 8.14</a>, which is based on work in <a href="S_primefactorizations.html#PA_exporingexamples" class="internal" title="Beginning Activity: Beginning Activity 1: Exploring Examples where \(\boldsymbol{a}\) Divides \(\boldsymbol{b \cdot c}\)">Beginning Activity 1</a>.</p>
