<p>This section contains many results concerning the properties of the set operations. We have already proved some of the results. Others will be proved in this section or in the exercises. The primary purpose of this section is to have in one place many of the properties of set operations that we may use in later proofs. These results are part of what is known as the <dfn class="terminology">algebra of sets</dfn> or as <dfn class="terminology">set theory</dfn>.</p>
