<p>For the inductive step, let <span class="process-math">\(k \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(k \geq 2\text{.}\)</span> We will assume that <span class="process-math">\(P( 2 ), P( 3 ), \ldots , P( k )\)</span> are true. The goal now is to prove that <span class="process-math">\(P( {k + 1} )\)</span> is true. To prove this, we assume that <span class="process-math">\((k + 1)\)</span> has two prime factorizations and then prove that these prime factorizations are the same. So we assume that <blockquote class="blockquote">
<span class="process-math">\(k + 1 = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(k + 1 = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_s\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(p_1 , p_2 , \ldots, p_r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q_1 , q_2 , \ldots, q_s\)</span> are primes with <span class="process-math">\(p_1 \leq p_2 \leq \cdots \leq p_r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q_1 \leq q_2 \leq \cdots \leq q_s\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> We must now prove that <span class="process-math">\(r = s\text{,}\)</span> and for each <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> from 1 to <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(p_j = q_j\text{.}\)</span> We can break our proof into two cases: (1) <span class="process-math">\(p_1 \leq q_1\text{;}\)</span> and (2) <span class="process-math">\(q_1 \leq p_1\text{.}\)</span> Since one of these must be true, and since the proofs will be similar, we can assume, without loss of generality, that <span class="process-math">\(p_1 \leq q_1\text{.}\)</span></p>
