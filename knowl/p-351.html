<p> A <dfn class="terminology">mathematical proof</dfn> is a convincing argument (within the accepted standards of the mathematical community) that a certain mathematical statement is necessarily true. A proof generally uses deductive reasoning and logic but also contains some amount of ordinary language (such as English). A mathematical proof that you write should convince an appropriate audience that the result you are proving is in fact true. So we do not consider a proof complete until there is a well-written proof. So it is important to introduce some writing guidelines. The preceding proof was written according to the following basic guidelines for writing proofs. More writing guidelines will be given in <a href="C_proofs.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Begin with a carefully worded statement of the theorem or result to be proven.</span></span><p>This should be a simple declarative statement of the theorem or result. Do not simply rewrite the problem as stated in the textbook or given on a handout. Problems often begin with phrases such as “Show that” or “Prove that.” This should be reworded as a simple declarative statement of the theorem. Then skip a line and write “Proof” in italics or boldface font (when using a word processor). Begin the proof on the same line. Make sure that all paragraphs can be easily identified. Skipping a line between paragraphs or indenting each paragraph can accomplish this.</p>
<p>As an example, an exercise in a text might read, “Prove that if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an odd integer, then <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> is an odd integer.” This could be started as follows: <blockquote class="blockquote">
<em class="emphasis">Theorem.</em> If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an odd integer, then <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> is an odd integer.</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">
<em class="emphasis">Proof</em>: We assume that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an odd integer <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\)</span>
</blockquote></p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Begin the proof with a statement of your assumptions.</span></span><p>Follow the statement of your assumptions with a statement of what you will prove. <blockquote class="blockquote">Theorem. If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an odd integer, then <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> is an odd integer.</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">Proof. We assume that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an odd integer and will prove that <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> is an odd integer.</blockquote></p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Use the pronoun “we”.</span></span><p>If a pronoun is used in a proof, the usual convention is to use “we” instead of “I.” The idea is to stress that you and the reader are doing the mathematics together. It will help encourage the reader to continue working through the mathematics. Notice that we started the proof of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_xyodd.html" title="Theorem 1.10">Theorem 1.10</a> with “We assume that <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\)</span> .”</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Use italics for variables when using a word processor.</span></span><p>When using a word processor to write mathematics, the word processor needs to be capable of producing the appropriate mathematical symbols and equations. The mathematics that is written with a word processor should look like typeset mathematics. This means that italics is used for variables, boldface font is used for vectors, and regular font is used for mathematical terms such as the names of the trigonometric and logarithmic functions. For example, we do not write sin (x) or <em class="emphasis">sin (x)</em>. The proper way to typeset this is <span class="process-math">\(\sin (x)\text{.}\)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Display important equations and mathematical expressions.</span></span><p>Equations and manipulations are often an integral part of mathematical exposition. Do not write equations, algebraic manipulations, or formulas in one column with reasons given in another column. Important equations and manipulations should be displayed. This means that they should be centered with blank lines before and after the equation or manipulations, and if the left side of the equations does not change, it should not be repeated. For example,</p>
<p>Using algebra, we obtain</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
x \cdot y \amp = \left( {2m + 1} \right)\left( {2n + 1} \right)\\
\amp = 4mn + 2m + 2n + 1\\
\amp = 2\left( {2mn + m + n} \right) + 1\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> are integers, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\)</span> .</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Tell the reader when the proof has been completed.</span></span><p>Perhaps the best way to do this is to simply write, “This completes the proof.” Although it may seem repetitive, a good alternative is to finish a proof with a sentence that states precisely what has been proven. In any case, it is usually good practice to use some “end of proof symbol” such as <span class="process-math">\(\blacksquare\text{.}\)</span></p>
