  <subsection>
    <title>Equivalent Sets</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA_equivalentsets"></xref>,
      we introduced the concept of equivalent sets.
      The motivation for this definition was to have a formal method for determining whether or not two sets
      <q>have the same number of elements.</q>
      This idea was described in terms of a one-to-one correspondence (a bijection) from one set onto the other set.
      This idea may seem simple for finite sets, but as we will see,
      this idea has surprising consequences when we deal with infinite sets.
      (We will soon provide precise definitions for finite and infinite sets.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Technical Note</em>: The three properties we proved in <xref ref="T_equivsets"></xref>
      in <xref ref="PA_equivsets2"></xref>
      are very similar to the concepts of reflexive,
      symmetric, and transitive relations.
      However, we do not consider equivalence of sets to be an equivalence relation on a set <m>U</m> since an equivalence relation requires an underlying (universal) set <m>U</m>.
      In this case,
      our elements would be the sets <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>,
      and these would then have to be subsets of some universal set <m>W</m>
      (elements of the power set of <m>W</m>).
      For equivalence of sets, we are not requiring that the sets <m>A</m>,
      <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> be subsets of the same universal set.
      So we do not use the term relation in regards to the equivalence of sets.
      However, if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are sets and <m>A \approx B</m>,
      then we often say that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are
      <em>equivalent sets</em>.
    </p>
    <exercise xml:id="prog_equivsets">
      <title>Examples of Equivalent Sets</title>
      <p>
        We will use the definition of equivalent sets from <xref ref="PA_equivalentsets"></xref>
        in all parts of this progress check.
        It is no longer sufficient to say that two sets are equivalent by simply saying that the two sets have the same number of elements.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>A = \left\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 99, 100 \right\}</m> and let <m>B = \left\{ 351, 352, 353, \ldots, 449, 450 \right\}</m>.
              Define <m>f\x A \to B</m> by <m>f(x) = x + 350</m>,
              for each <m>x</m> in <m>A</m>.
              Prove that <m>f</m> is a bijection from the set <m>A</m> to the set <m>B</m> and hence,
              <m>A \approx B</m>.

              Let <m>E</m> be the set of all even integers and let <m>D</m> be the set of all odd integers.
              Prove that <m>E \approx D</m> by proving that <m>F\x E \to D</m>,
              where <m>F \left( x \right) = x + 1</m>,
              for all <m>x \in E</m>, is a bijection.

            <p>
              Let <m>\left( 0, 1 \right)</m> be the open interval of real numbers between 0 and 1.

              let <m>\left( 0, b \right)</m> be the open interval of real numbers between 0 and <m>b</m>.
              Prove that the function <m>f\x \left( 0, 1 \right) \to \left( 0, b \right)</m> by <m>f \left( x \right) = bx</m>,
              for all <m>x \in \left( 0, 1 \right)</m>,
              is a bijection and hence <m>\left( 0, 1 \right) \approx \left( 0, b \right)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="A_equivsets4"/> of <xref ref="prog_equivsets"></xref>,
      notice that if <m>b > 1</m>,
      then <m>\left( 0, 1 \right)</m> is a proper subset of
      <m>\left( 0, b \right)</m> and <m>\left( 0, 1 \right) \approx \left( 0, b \right)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, in <xref ref="PA_equivalentsets5"/> of <xref ref="PA_equivalentsets"></xref>,
      we proved that the set <m>D</m> of all odd natural numbers is equivalent to <m>\mathbb{N}</m>,
      and we know that <m>D</m> is a proper subset of <m>\mathbb{N}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      These results may seem a bit strange,
      but they are logical consequences of the definition of equivalent sets.
      Although we have not defined the terms yet,
      we will see that one thing that will distinguish an infinite set from a finite set is that an infinite set can be equivalent to one of its proper subsets,
      whereas a finite set cannot be equivalent to one of its proper subsets.

    <title>Finite Sets</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="S_setoperations"></xref>,
      we defined the <em>cardinality</em>

      of a finite set <m>A</m>,
      denoted by <m>\card (A)</m>, to be the number of elements in the set <m>A</m>.
      Now that we know about functions and bijections,
      we can define this concept more formally and more rigorously.
      First, for each <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
      we define <m>\mathbb{N}_k</m> to be the set of all natural numbers between 1 and <m>k</m>,
      inclusive.
      That is,
      <me>
        \mathbb{N}_k = \left\{ 1, 2, \ldots, k \right\}\!

    <p>
      We will use the concept of <em>equivalent sets</em>
          <idx><h>equivalent sets</h></idx>
      introduced in <xref ref="PA_equivalentsets"></xref> to define a finite set.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="cardinalityfinite">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A set <m>A</m> is a <term>finite set</term>

        <p>
          If <m>A \approx \mathbb{N}_k</m>,

      Notice that by this definition,
      the empty set is a finite set.
      In addition, for each <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
      the identity function on <m>\mathbb{N}_k</m> is a bijection and hence,

        Suppose that <m>A</m> is a finite nonempty set,

        We also have assumed that <m>A \approx B</m> and so by part<nbsp/>(b) of <xref ref="T_equivsets"></xref>
        (in <xref ref="PA_equivsets2"></xref>),
        we can conclude that <m>B \approx A</m>.
        Since <m>A \approx \mathbb{N}_k</m>,
        we can use part<nbsp/>(c) of <xref ref="T_equivsets"></xref>

        Thus, <m>B</m> is finite and has the same cardinality as <m>A</m>.

    <p>
      It may seem that we have done a lot of work to prove an
      <q>obvious</q>
      result in <xref ref="T_equivfinitesets"></xref>.
      The same may be true of the remaining results in this section,
      which give further results about finite sets.
      One of the goals is to make sure that the concept of cardinality for a finite set corresponds to our intuitive notion of the number of elements in the set.
      Another important goal is to lay the groundwork for a more rigorous and mathematical treatment of infinite sets than we have encountered before.
      Along the way,
      we will see the mathematical distinction between finite and infinite sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following two lemmas will be used to prove the theorem that states that every subset of a finite set is finite.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="L_addone">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> is a finite set and <m>x \notin A</m>,
          then <m>A \cup \left\{ x \right\}</m> is a finite set and <m>\text{ card } \!\left( A \cup \left\{ x \right\} \right) = \text{ card } ( A ) + 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a finite set and assume <m>\text{ card } ( A ) = k</m>,
        where <m>k = 0</m> or <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
        Assume <m>x \notin A</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>A = \emptyset</m>,
        then <m>\text{ card } ( A ) = 0</m> and <m>A \cup \left\{ x \right\} = \left\{ x \right\}</m>,
        which is equivalent to <m>\mathbb{N}_1</m>.
        Thus, <m>A \cup \left\{ x \right\}</m> is finite with cardinality 1, which equals <m>\text{ card } ( A ) + 1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>A \ne \emptyset</m>,
        then <m>A \approx \mathbb{N}_k</m>,
        for some <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
        This means that <m>\text{ card } ( A ) = k</m>,
        and there exists a bijection <m>f\x A \to \mathbb{N}_k</m>.
        We will now use this bijection to define a function
        <m>g\x A \cup \left\{ x \right\} \to \mathbb{N}_{k+1}</m> and then prove that the function <m>g</m> is a bijection.
        We define <m>g\x A \cup \left\{ x \right\} \to \mathbb{N}_{k+1}</m> as follows: For each <m>t \in A \cup \left\{ x \right\}</m>,
        <me>
          g \left( t \right) = \left\{ \begin{gathered} f \left( t \right) \text{  if  } t \in A  \\ k + 1 \text{  if  } t = x. \end{gathered}  \right.
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove that <m>g</m> is an injection,
        we let <m>x_1, x_2 \in A \cup \left\{ x \right\}</m> and assume <m>x_1 \ne x_2</m>.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>x_1, x_2 \in A</m>,
              then since <m>f</m> is a bijection,
              <m>f( x_1 ) \ne f ( x_2 )</m>,
              and this implies that <m>g( x_1 ) \ne g( x_2 )</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>x_1 = x</m>, then since <m>x_2 \ne x_1</m>,
              we conclude that <m>x_2 \ne x</m> and hence <m>x_2 \in A</m>.
              So <m>g( x_1 ) = k + 1</m>,
              and since <m>f( x_2 ) \in \mathbb{N}_k</m> and <m>g( x_2 ) = f ( x_2 )</m>,
              we can conclude that <m>g( x_1 ) \ne g( x_2 )</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The case where <m>x_2 = x</m> is handled similarly to the previous case.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        This proves that the function <m>g</m> is an injection.
        The proof that <m>g</m> is a surjection is <xref ref="exer_addonesurjection"/>.
        Since <m>g</m> is a bijection,
        we conclude that <m>A \cup \left\{ x \right\} \approx \mathbb{N}_{k+1}</m>, and
        <me>
          \text{ card }  \!\left(A \cup \left\{ x \right\} \right) = k + 1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>\text{ card } \left(A \right) = k</m>,
        we have proved that <m>\text{ card } \!\left(A \cup \left\{ x \right\} \right) = \text{ card } ( A ) + 1</m>.
      </p>

    <lemma xml:id="L_subsetsofNk">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For each natural number <m>m</m>,
          if <m>A \subseteq \mathbb{N}_m</m>,
          then <m>A</m> is a finite set and <m>\text{ card } \left( A \right) \leq m</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will use a proof using induction on <m>m</m>.
        For each <m>m \in \mathbb{N}</m>, let <m>P( m )</m> be,
        <q>If <m>A \subseteq \mathbb{N}_m</m>,
        then <m>A</m> is finite and <m>\text{ card } ( A ) \leq m</m>.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        We first prove that <m>P( 1 )</m> is true.
        If <m>A \subseteq \mathbb{N}_1</m>,
        then <m>A = \emptyset</m> or <m>A = \left\{ 1 \right\}</m>,
        both of which are finite and have cardinality less than or equal to the cardinality of <m>\mathbb{N}_1</m>.
        This proves that <m>P( 1 )</m> is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the inductive step, let
        <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m> and assume that <m>P( k )</m> is true.
        That is, assume that if <m>B \subseteq \mathbb{N}_k</m>,
        then <m>B</m> is a finite set and <m>\text{ card } ( B ) \leq k</m>.
        We need to prove that <m>P( k+1 )</m> is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        So assume that <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>\mathbb{N}_{k+1}</m>.
        Then <m>A - \left\{ k+1 \right\}</m> is a subset of <m>\mathbb{N}_k</m>.
        Since <m>P( k )</m> is true,
        <m>A - \left\{ k+1 \right\}</m> is a finite set and
        <me>
          \text{ card }  \!\left( A - \left\{ k+1 \right\} \right) \leq k
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two cases to consider: Either
        <m>k+1 \in A</m> or <m>k+1 \not \in A</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>k+1 \not \in A</m>, then <m>A = A - \left\{ k+1 \right\}</m>.
        Hence, <m>A</m> is finite and
        <me>
          \text{ card }  ( A ) \leq k \lt  k+1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>k+1 \in A</m>,
        then <m>A = ( A - \left\{ k+1 \right\} ) \cup \left\{ k+1 \right\}</m>.
        Hence, by <xref ref="L_addone"></xref>,
        <m>A</m> is a finite set and
        <me>
          \text{ card }  ( A ) = \text{ card }  \!\left(  A - \left\{ k+1 \right\}  \right) + 1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>\text{ card } \!\left( A - \left\{ k+1 \right\} \right) \leq k</m>,
        we can conclude that <m>\text{ card } ( A ) \leq k + 1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that we have proved the inductive step.
        Hence, by mathematical induction,
        for each <m>m \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
        if <m>A \subseteq \mathbb{N}_m</m>,
        then <m>A</m> is finite and <m>\text{ card } ( A ) \leq m</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The preceding two lemmas were proved to aid in the proof of the following theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_finitesubsets">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>S</m> is a finite set and <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>S</m>,
          then <m>A</m> is a finite set and <m>\text{ card } ( A ) \leq \text{ card } ( S )</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>S</m> be a finite set and assume that <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>S</m>.
        If <m>A = \emptyset</m>,
        then <m>A</m> is a finite set and <m>\text{ card } ( A ) \leq \text{ card } ( S )</m>.
        So we assume that <m>A \ne \emptyset</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>S</m> is finite,
        there exists a bijection <m>f\x S \to \mathbb{N}_k</m> for some <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
        In this case, <m>\text{ card } ( S ) = k</m>.
        We need to show that <m>A</m> is equivalent to a finite set.
        To do this, we define <m>g\x A \to f ( A )</m> by
        <m>g ( x ) = f ( x )</m> for each <m>x \in A</m>.
        Since <m>f</m> is an injection,
        we conclude that <m>g</m> is an injection.
        Now let <m>y \in f ( A )</m>.
        Then there exists an <m>a \in A</m> such that <m>f ( a ) = y</m>.
        But by the definition of <m>g</m>,
        this means that <m>g ( a ) = y</m>,
        and hence <m>g</m> is a surjection.
        This proves that <m>g</m> is a bijection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, we have proved that <m>A \approx f ( A )</m>.
        Since <m>f ( A )</m> is a subset of <m>\mathbb{N}_k</m>,
        we use <xref ref="L_subsetsofNk"></xref>
        to conclude that <m>f ( A )</m> is finite and <m>\text{ card } ( f ( A ) ) \leq k</m>.
        In addition, by <xref ref="T_equivfinitesets"></xref>,
        <m>A</m> is a finite set and <m>\text{ card } ( A ) = \text{ card } ( f ( A ) )</m>.
        This proves that <m>A</m> is a finite set and <m>\text{ card } ( A ) \leq \text{ card } ( S )</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      <xref ref="L_addone"></xref>
      implies that adding one element to a finite set increases its cardinality by 1.
      It is also true that removing one element from a finite nonempty set reduces the cardinality by 1.

        <p>
          A finite set is not equivalent to any of its proper subsets.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </corollary>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>B</m> be a finite set and assume that <m>A</m> is a proper subset of <m>B</m>.
        Since <m>A</m> is a proper subset of <m>B</m>,
        there exists an element <m>x</m> in <m>B - A</m>.
        This means that <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>B - \left\{ x \right\}</m>.
        Hence, by <xref ref="T_finitesubsets"></xref>,
        <me>
          \text{ card }  ( A ) \leq \text{ card }  \!\left( B - \left\{ x \right\} \right)
        </me>.

      <p>
        Also, by <xref ref="C_removeone"></xref>
        <me>
          \text{ card }  \!\left( B - \left\{ x \right\} \right) = \text{ card }  ( B ) - 1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, we may conclude that <m>\text{ card }  ( A ) \leq \text{ card }  ( B ) - 1</m> and that
        <me>
          \text{ card }  ( A ) \lt  \text{ card }  ( B )

      </p>
      <p>
        <xref ref="T_equivfinitesets"></xref>
        implies that <m>B \not \approx A</m>.
        This proves that a finite set is not equivalent to any of its proper subsets.

    <title>The Pigeonhole Principle</title>
    <p>
      The last property of finite sets that we will consider in this section is often called the
      <em>Pigeonhole Principle</em>.
          <idx><h>Pigeonhole Principle</h></idx>
      The
      <q>pigeonhole</q>
      version of this property says,
      <q>If <m>m</m> pigeons go into <m>r</m> pigeonholes and <m>m > r</m>,
      then at least one pigeonhole has more than one pigeon.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this situation,
      we can think of the set of pigeons as being equivalent to a set <m>P</m> with cardinality <m>m</m> and the set of pigeonholes as being equivalent to a set <m>H</m> with cardinality <m>r</m>.
      We can then define a function
      <m>f\x P \to H</m> that maps each pigeon to its pigeonhole.
      The Pigeonhole Principle states that this function is not an injection.
      (It is not one-to-one since there are at least two pigeons
      <q>mapped</q>
      to the same pigeonhole.)
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_pigeonhole">
      <title>The Pigeonhole Principle</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be finite sets.
          If <m>\text{ card } ( A ) > \text{ card } ( B )</m>,
          then any function <m>f\x A \to B</m> is not an injection.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be finite sets.
        We will prove the contrapositive of the theorem, which is,
        if there exists a function
        <m>f\x A \to B</m> that is an injection,
        then <m>\text{ card } ( A ) \leq \text{ card } ( B )</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So assume that <m>f\x A \to B</m> is an injection.
        As in <xref ref="T_finitesubsets"></xref>,
        we define a function <m>g\x A \to f ( A )</m> by
        <m>g ( x ) = f ( x )</m> for each <m>x \in A</m>.
        As we saw in <xref ref="T_finitesubsets"></xref>,
        the function <m>g</m> is a bijection.
        But then <m>A \approx f ( A )</m> and <m>f ( A ) \subseteq B</m>.
        Hence, <m>\text{ card } ( A ) = \text{ card } \!\left( f ( A ) \right)</m> and <m>\text{ card } \!\left( f ( A ) \right) \leq \text{ card } ( B )</m>.
        Hence, <m>\text{ card } ( A ) \leq \text{ card } ( B )</m>,
        and this proves the contrapositive.
        Hence, if <m>\text{ card } ( A ) > \text{ card } ( B )</m>,
        then any function <m>f\x A \to B</m> is not an injection.
      </p>

          This exercise is a generalization of <xref ref="exer_sec927"/>.
          Let <m>m</m> be a natural number, let <m>A</m> be a set,
          and assume that <m>f:\mathbb{N}_m \to A</m> is a surjection.
          Define <m>g:A \to \mathbb{N}_m</m> as follows:
          <ul>
            \item For each <m>x \in A</m>, <m>g ( x ) = j</m>, where <m>j</m> is the least natural number in <m>f^{-1} ( \left\{ x \right\} )</m>.
          </ul>
        </p>
        Prove that <m>f \circ g = I_A</m>, where <m>I_A</m> is the identity function on the set <m>A</m>, and prove that <m>g</m> is an injection.

        <p>
          Let <m>B</m> be a finite,
          nonempty set and assume that <m>f:B \to A</m> is a surjection.
          Prove that there exists a function <m>h:A \to B</m> such that
          <m>f \circ h = I_A</m> and <m>h</m> is an injection. \hint Since <m>B</m> is finite,
          there exists a natural number <m>m</m> such that <m>\mathbb{N}_m \approx B</m>.
          This means there exists a bijection <m>k:\mathbb{N}_m \to B</m>.
          Now let <m>h = k \circ g</m>,
          where <m>g</m> is the function constructed in <xref ref="exer_sec928"/>.
