<p>Several Progress Checks are included in each section. These are either short exercises or short activities designed to help you determine if you are understanding the material as you are studying the material in the section. As such, it is important to work through these progress checks to test your understanding, and if necessary, study the material again before proceeding further. So it is important to attempt these progress checks before checking the answers, which are provided in <a href="prog-answers.html" class="internal" title="Appendix B: Answers for the Progress Checks">AppendixÂ B</a>.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="fm-student-note.html#li-21" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
