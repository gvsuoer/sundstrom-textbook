</h3>
<p>Issues dealing with writing mathematical exposition are addressed throughout the book. Guidelines for writing mathematical proofs are incorporated into the book. These guidelines are introduced as needed and begin in <a href="S_1direct.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.2: Constructing Direct Proofs">Section 1.2</a>. <a href="C_writingguides.html" class="internal" title="Appendix A: Guidelines for Writing Mathematical Proofs">Appendix A</a> contains a summary of all the guidelines for writing mathematical proofs that are introduced throughout the text. In addition, every attempt has been made to ensure that every completed proof presented in this text is written according to these guidelines. This provides students with examples of well-written proofs.</p>
<p>One of the motivating factors for writing this book was to develop a textbook for the course “Communicating in Mathematics” at Grand Valley State University. This course is part of the university's Supplemental Writing Skills Program, and there was no text that dealt with writing issues in mathematics that was suitable for this course. This is why some of the writing guidelines in the text deal with the use of <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> or a word processor that is capable of producing the appropriate mathematical symbols and equations. However, the writing guidelines can easily be implemented for courses where students do not have access to this type of word processing.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="fm-preface.html#li-30" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
