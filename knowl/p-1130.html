<p>The following definition of a prime number is very important in many areas of mathematics. We will use this definition at various places in the text. It is introduced now as an example of how to work with a definition in mathematics. <article class="assemblage assemblage-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Definition.</span></h5>
<p>A natural number <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is a <dfn class="terminology">prime number</dfn> provided that it is greater than 1 and the only natural numbers that are factors of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> are 1 and <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span> A natural number other than 1 that is not a prime number is a <dfn class="terminology">composite number</dfn>. The number 1 is neither prime nor composite.</p></article> Using the definition of a prime number, we see that 2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime numbers. Also, 4 is a composite number since <span class="process-math">\(4 = 2 \cdot 2\text{;}\)</span> 10 is a composite number since <span class="process-math">\(10 = 2 \cdot 5\text{;}\)</span> and 60 is a composite number since <span class="process-math">\(60 = 4 \cdot 15\text{.}\)</span></p>
