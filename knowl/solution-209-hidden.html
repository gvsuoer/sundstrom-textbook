<p>The function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is an injection but not a surjection. To see that it is an injection, let <span class="process-math">\(a, b \in \R\)</span> and assume that <span class="process-math">\(f(a) = f(b)\text{.}\)</span> This implies that <span class="process-math">\(e^{-a} = e^{-b}\text{.}\)</span> Now use the natural logarithm function to prove that <span class="process-math">\(a = b\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(e^{-x} &gt; 0\)</span> for each real number <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> there is no <span class="process-math">\(x \in \R\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = -1\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not a surjection.</p>
<p>The function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is an injection and is a surjection. The proof that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is an injection is basically the same as the proof that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is an injection. To prove that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is a surjection, let <span class="process-math">\(b \in \R^+\text{.}\)</span> To construct the real number <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(g(a) = b\text{,}\)</span> solve the equation <span class="process-math">\(e^{-a} = b\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> The solution is <span class="process-math">\(a = -\ln b\text{.}\)</span> It can then be verified that <span class="process-math">\(g(a) = b\text{.}\)</span></p>
