<p> In dealing with mathematical statements, we frequently use the terms “conjecture,” “theorem,” “proposition,” “lemma,” and “corollary.” A <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">conjecture</dfn> is a statement that we believe is plausible. That is, we think it is true, but we have not yet developed a proof that it is true. A <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">theorem</dfn> is a mathematical statement for which we have a proof. A term that is often considered to be synonymous with “theorem” is <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">proposition</dfn>. Often the proof of a theorem can be quite long. In this case, it is often easier to communicate the proof in smaller “pieces.” These supporting pieces are often called lemmas. A <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">lemma</dfn> is a true mathematical statement that was proven mainly to help in the proof of some theorem. Once a given theorem has been proven, it is often the case that other propositions follow immediately from the fact that the theorem is true. These are called corollaries of the theorem. The term <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">corollary</dfn> is used to refer to a theorem that is easily proven once some other theorem has been proven.</p>
