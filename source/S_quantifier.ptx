      <title>An Introduction to Quantifiers</title>
      <p>
            <idx><h>quantifier</h></idx>
        We have seen that one way to create a statement from an open sentence is to substitute a specific element from the universal set for each variable in the open sentence.
        Another way is to make some claim about the truth set of the open sentence.
        This is often done by using a quantifier.
        For example, if the universal set is <m>\mathbb{R}</m>,
        then the following sentence is a statement.
        For each real number <m>x</m>, <m>x^2 > 0</m>.
        The phrase
        <q>For each real number <m>x</m></q>
        is said to <term>quantify the variable</term>
        that follows it in the sense that the sentence is claiming that something is true for all real numbers.
        So this sentence is a statement
        (which happens to be false).

      <definition xml:id="D_every">
        <statement>
          <p>
            The phrase
            <q>for every</q>
            (or its equivalents) is called a
            <term>universal quantifier</term>.
                <idx><h>universal quantifier</h></idx>
                <idx><h>quantifier</h><h>universal</h></idx>
            The phrase
            <q>there exists</q>
            (or its equivalents) is called an
            <term>existential quantifier</term>.
                <idx><h>existential quantifier</h></idx>
                <idx><h>quantifier</h><h>existential</h></idx>
            The symbol <m>\forall</m> is used to denote a universal quantifier, and the symbol <m>\exists</m> is used to denote an existential quantifier.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
      <p>
        Using this notation, the statement
        <q>For each real number <m>x</m>, <m>x^2 > 0</m></q>
        could be written in symbolic form as:
        <m>\left( {\forall x \in \mathbb{R}} \right)\left( {x^2 > 0} \right)</m>.
        The following is an example of a statement involving an existential quantifier.
        There exists an integer <m>x</m> such that <m>3x - 2 = 0</m>.
        This could be written in symbolic form as
        <me>
          \left( {\exists x \in \Z} \right) \left( 3x - 2 = 0 \right)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This statement is false because there are no integers that are solutions of the linear equation <m>3x - 2 = 0</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Forms of Quantified Statements in English</title>
    <p>
      There are many ways to write statements involving quantifiers in English.
      In some cases, the quantifiers are not apparent,
      and this often happens with conditional statements.
      The following examples illustrate these points.
      Each example contains a quantified statement written in symbolic form followed by several ways to write the statement in English.
      <ol>
        <li xml:id="D_counterexample">
          <p>
            <m>\left( {\forall x \in \mathbb{R}} \right)\left( {x^2 > 0} \right)</m>.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  For each real number <m>x</m>, <m>x^2 > 0</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The square of every real number is greater than 0.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The square of a real number is greater than 0.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m>, then <m>x^2 > 0</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          In the second to the last example, the quantifier is not stated explicitly.  Care must be taken when reading this because it really does say the same thing as the previous examples. The last example illustrates the fact that conditional statements often contain a
          <q>hidden</q>
          universal quantifier.  If the universal set is  <m>\R</m>, then the truth set of the open sentence  <m>x^2  > 0</m> is the set of all nonzero real numbers.  That is, the truth set is
          <me>
            \left\{ {x \in \mathbb{R}} \mid x \ne 0 \right\}
          </me>.
          So the preceding statements are false.  For the conditional statement, the example using <m>x = 0</m> produces a true hypothesis and a false conclusion.  This is a <em>counterexample</em>
    <idx><h>counterexample</h></idx>
      that shows that the statement with a universal quantifier is false.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\left( {\exists x \in \mathbb{R}} \right)\left( {x^2 = 5} \right)</m>.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  There exists a real number <m>x</m> such that <m>x^2 = 5</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>x^2 = 5</m> for some real number <m>x</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  There is a real number whose square equals 5.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          The second example is usually not used since it is not considered good writing practice to start a sentence with a mathematical symbol.
          If the universal set is <m>\R</m>,
          then the truth set of the predicate
          <q><m>x^2 = 5</m></q>
          is <m>\left\{ { - \sqrt 5 ,\;\sqrt 5 } \right\}</m>.
          So these are all true statements.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <title>Negations of Quantified Statements</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>negation</h><h>of a quantified statement</h></idx>
      In <xref ref="PA_quantifier"></xref>,
      we wrote negations of some quantified statements.
      This is a very important mathematical activity.
      As we will see in future sections,
      it is sometimes just as important to be able to describe when some object does not satisfy a certain property as it is to describe when the object satisfies the property.
      Our next task is to learn how to write negations of quantified statements in a useful English form.
    </p>
    <p>
      We first look at the negation of a statement involving a universal quantifier.
      The general form for such a statement can be written as <m>\left( {\forall x} \in U \right)\left( {P( x )} \right)</m>,
      where <m>P( x )</m> is an open sentence and <m>U</m> is the universal set for the variable <m>x</m>.
      When we write
      <me>
        \mynot  \left( {\forall x} \in U \right)\left[ {P\left( x \right)} \right]
      </me>,
      we are asserting that the statement <m>\left( {\forall x} \in U \right)\left[ {P( x )} \right]</m> is false.
      This is equivalent to saying that the truth set of the open sentence <m>P( x )</m> is not the universal set.
      That is, there exists an element <m>x</m> in the universal set <m>U</m> such that <m>P( x )</m> is false.
      This in turn means that there exists an element <m>x</m> in <m>U</m> such that <m>\mynot  P( x )</m> is true,
      which is equivalent to saying that <m>\left( {\exists x} \in U \right)\left[ {\mynot  P( x )} \right]</m> is true.
      This explains why the following result is true:
      <me>
        \mynot  \left( {\forall x} \in U \right)\left[ {P( x )} \right] \equiv \left( {\exists x} \in U \right)\left[ {\mynot  P( x )} \right]
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, when we write
      <me>
        \mynot  \left( {\exists x} \in U \right)\left[ {P( x )} \right]
      </me>,
      we are asserting that the statement <m>\left( {\exists x} \in U \right)\left[ {P( x )} \right]</m> is false.
      This is equivalent to saying that the truth set of the open sentence <m>P( x )</m> is the empty set.
      That is, there is no element <m>x</m> in the universal set <m>U</m> such that <m>P( x )</m> is true.
      This in turn means that for each element <m>x</m> in <m>U</m>,
      <m>\mynot  P( x )</m> is true,
      and this is equivalent to saying that <m>\left( {\forall x} \in U \right)\left[ {\mynot  P( x )} \right]</m> is true.
      This explains why the following result is true:
      <me>
        \mynot  \left( {\exists x} \in U \right)\left[ {P( x )} \right] \equiv \left( {\forall x} \in U \right)\left[ {\mynot  P( x )} \right]
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We summarize these results in the following theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_negations">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any open sentence <m>P( x )</m>,
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\mynot  \left( {\forall x} \in U \right)\left[ {P( x )} \right] \amp \equiv \left( {\exists x} \in U \right)\left[ {\mynot  P( x )} \right]\text{ , and }  \\ \mynot  \left( {\exists x} \in U \right)\left[ {P( x )} \right] \amp \equiv \left( {\forall x} \in U \right)\left[ {\mynot  P( x )} \right]. \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <example xml:id="E_negations">
      <title>Negations of Quantified Statements</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the following statement:

        <p>
          We can write this statement as an English sentence in several ways.

          The second statement shows that in a conditional statement,
          there is often a hidden universal quantifier.
          This statement is false since there are real numbers <m>x</m> for which <m>x^3</m> is not greater than or equal to <m>x^2</m>.
          For example,
          we could use <m>x = - 1</m> or <m>x = \frac{1}{2}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that the negation must be true.
          We can form the negation as follows:
          <me>
            \mynot  \left( {\forall x \in \mathbb{R}} \right)\left( {x^3  \geq x^2 } \right) \equiv \left( {\exists x \in \mathbb{R}} \right)\mynot  \left( {x^3  \geq x^2 } \right)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In most cases,
          we want to write this negation in a way that does not use the negation symbol.
          In this case,
          we can now write the open sentence <m>\mynot  \left( {x^3  \geq x^2 } \right)</m> as
          <m>\left( {x^3  \lt  x^2 } \right)</m>. (That is, the negation of
          <q>is greater than or equal to</q>
          is
          <q>is less than.</q>
          ) So we obtain the following:
          <me>
            \mynot  \left( {\forall x \in \mathbb{R}} \right)\left( {x^3  \geq x^2 } \right) \equiv \left( {\exists x \in \mathbb{R}} \right)\left( {x^3  \lt  x^2 } \right)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The statement <m>\left( {\exists x \in \mathbb{R}} \right)\left( {x^3 \lt x^2 } \right)</m> could be written in English as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                There exists a real number <m>x</m> such that <m>x^3 \lt x^2</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                There exists an <m>x</m> such that <m>x</m> is a real number and <m>x^3 \lt x^2</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

    <title>Counterexamples and Negations of Conditional Statements</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>negation</h><h>of a conditional statement</h></idx>
      The real number <m>x = - 1</m> in the previous example was used to show that the statement <m>\left( {\forall x \in \mathbb{R}} \right)\left( {x^3 \geq x^2 } \right)</m> is false.
      This is called a <em>counterexample</em> to the statement.
      In general, a <em>counterexample</em>
      to a statement of the form
      <m>\left( {\forall x} \right)\left[ {P( x )} \right]</m> is an object <m>a</m> in the universal set <m>U</m> for which <m>P( a )</m> is false.
      It is an example that proves that
      <m>\left( {\forall x} \right)\left[ {P( x )} \right]</m> is a false statement,
      and hence its negation,
      <m>\left( {\exists x} \right)\left[ {\mynot P( x )} \right]</m>,
      is a true statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the preceding example,
      we also wrote the universally quantified statement as a conditional statement.
      The number <m>x =  - 1</m> is a counterexample for the statement If <m>x</m> is a real number,
      then <m>x^3</m> is greater than or equal to <m>x^2</m>.
      So the number <m>-1</m> is an example that makes the hypothesis of the conditional statement true and the conclusion false.
      Remember that a conditional statement often contains a
      <q>hidden</q>
      universal quantifier.
      Also, recall that in <xref ref="S_logequiv"></xref>
      we saw that the negation of the conditional statement
      <q>If <m>P</m> then <m>Q</m></q>
      is the statement
      <q><m>P</m> and not <m>Q</m>.</q>
      Symbolically, this can be written as follows:
      <me>
        \mynot  \left( {P \to Q} \right) \equiv \;P \wedge \mynot  Q
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when we specifically include the universal quantifier,
      the symbolic form of the negation of a conditional statement is
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}\mynot  \left( {\forall x} \in U \right)\left[ {P( x ) \to Q( x )} \right] \amp \equiv \left( {\exists x} \in U \right)\mynot  \left[ {P( x ) \to Q( x )} \right] \\ \amp \equiv \left( {\exists x} \in U \right)\left[ {P( x ) \wedge \mynot  Q( x )} \right]. \end{aligned}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      That is,
      <me>
        \mynot  \left( {\forall x} \in U \right)\left[ {P( x ) \to Q( x )} \right] \equiv \left( {\exists x} \in U \right)\left[ {P( x ) \wedge \mynot  Q( x )} \right]

    <title>Quantifiers in Definitions</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>quantifier</h></idx>
      Definitions of terms in mathematics often involve quantifiers.
      These definitions are often given in a form that does not use the symbols for quantifiers.
      Not only is it important to know a definition,
      it is also important to be able to write a negation of the definition.
      This will be illustrated with the definition of what it means to say that a natural number is a perfect square.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="D_square">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A natural number <m>n</m> is a <term>perfect square</term>
              <idx><h>perfect square</h></idx>
          provided that there exists a natural number <m>k</m> such that <m>n = k^2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This definition can be written in symbolic form using appropriate quantifiers as follows: A natural number <m>n</m> is a <em>perfect square</em>
      provided <m>\left( {\exists k \in \mathbb{N}} \right) \! \left( {n = k^2 } \right)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We frequently use the following steps to gain a better understanding of a definition.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Examples of natural numbers that are perfect squares are 1, 4, 9, and 81 since <m>1 = 1^2</m>,
            <m>4 = 2^2</m>, <m>9 = 3^2</m>, and <m>81 = 9^2</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Examples of natural numbers that are not perfect squares are 2, 5, 10, and 50.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            This definition gives two
            <q>conditions.</q>
            One is that the natural number <m>n</m> is a perfect square and the other is that there exists a natural number <m>k</m> such that <m>n = k^2</m>.
            The definition states that these mean the same thing.
            So when we say that a natural number <m>n</m> is not a perfect square,
            we need to negate the condition that  there exists a natural number <m>k</m> such that <m>n = k^2</m>.
            We can use the symbolic form to do this.
            <me>
              \mynot \left( {\exists k \in \mathbb{N}} \right)\left( {n = k^2 } \right) \equiv \left( \forall k \in \N \right) \left( n \ne k^2 \right)
            </me>
            Notice that instead of writing <m>\mynot \left(n = k^2 \right)</m>,
            we used the equivalent form of <m>\left(n \ne k^2 \right)</m>.
            This will be easier to translate into an English sentence.
            So we can write,
            <ul>
              \item A natural number <m>n</m>  is not a perfect square provided that for every natural number <m>k</m>, <m>n \ne k^2</m>.
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      The preceding method illustrates a good method for trying to understand a new definition.
      Most textbooks will simply define a concept and leave it to the reader to do the preceding steps.
      Frequently, it is not sufficient just to read a definition and expect to understand the new term.
      We must provide examples that satisfy the definition,
      as well as examples that do not satisfy the definition,
      and we must be able to write a coherent negation of the definition.

    <title>Statements with More than One Quantifier</title>
    <p>
      When a predicate contains more than one variable,
      each variable must be quantified to create a statement.
      For example, assume the universal set is the set of integers,
      <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>,
      and let <m>P\left( {x, y} \right)</m> be the predicate,
      <q><m>x + y = 0</m>.</q>
      We can create a statement from this predicate in several ways.
      <ol>
        <li xml:id="twoquantifiers1">
          <p>
            <m>\left( {\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}} \right)\left( {\forall y \in \mathbb{Z}} \right)\left( {x + y = 0} \right)</m>.
            We could read this as,
            <q>For all integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, <m>x + y = 0</m>.</q>
            This is a false statement since it is possible to find two integers whose sum is not zero <m>\left( {2 + 3 \ne 0} \right)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li xml:id="twoquantifiers2">

            We could read this as,
            <q>For every integer <m>x</m>,
            there exists an integer <m>y</m> such that <m>x + y = 0</m>.</q>

            We could read this as,

            <m>x + y = 0</m>.</q>
            This is a false statement since there is no integer whose sum with each integer is zero.

        <li>
          <p>

            We could read this as,
            <q>There exist integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>x + y = 0</m>.</q>
            This is a true statement.
            For example, <m>2 + \left( { - 2} \right) = 0</m>.

    </p>
    <p>
      When we negate a statement with more than one quantifier,
      we consider each quantifier in turn and apply the appropriate part of <xref ref="T_negations"></xref>.
      As an example,
      we will negate Statement<nbsp/><xref ref="twoquantifiers3"/> from the preceding list.
      The statement is
      <me>
        \left( {\exists x \in \mathbb{Z}} \right)\left( {\forall y \in \mathbb{Z}} \right)\left( {x + y = 0} \right)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We first treat this as a statement in the following form:
      <m>\left( {\exists x \in \mathbb{Z}} \right)\left( {P( x )} \right)</m> where <m>P( x )</m> is the predicate <m>\left( {\forall y \in \mathbb{Z}} \right)\left( {x + y = 0} \right)</m>.
      Using <xref ref="T_negations"></xref>, we have
      <me>
        \mynot  \left( {\exists x \in \mathbb{Z}} \right)\left( {P( x )} \right) \equiv \left( {\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}} \right)\left( {\mynot  P( x )} \right)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using <xref ref="T_negations"></xref>
      again, we obtain the following:
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}\mynot  P( x ) \amp \equiv \mynot  \left( {\forall y \in \mathbb{Z}} \right)\left( {x + y = 0} \right) \\ \amp \equiv \left( {\exists y \in \mathbb{Z}} \right)\mynot  \left( {x + y = 0} \right) \\ \amp \equiv \left( {\exists y \in \mathbb{Z}} \right)\left( {x + y \ne 0} \right). \end{aligned}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Combining these two results, we obtain
      <me>
        \mynot  \left( {\exists x \in \mathbb{Z}} \right)\left( {\forall y \in \mathbb{Z}} \right)\left( {x + y = 0} \right) \equiv \left( {\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}} \right)\left( {\exists y \in \mathbb{Z}} \right)\left( {x + y \ne 0} \right)
      </me>.

    <title>Writing Guideline</title>

      Try to use English and minimize the use of cumbersome notation.
      Do not use the special symbols for quantifiers <m>\forall</m>
      (for all),
      <m>\exists</m>
      (there exists),
      <m>\mathrel\backepsilon</m>
      (such that),
      or <m>\therefore</m> (therefore) in formal mathematical writing.
      It is often easier to write and usually easier to read,
      if the English words are used instead of the symbols.
      For example, why make the reader interpret
      <me>
        \left( \forall x \in \R \right) \left( \exists y \in \R \right)\left( x + y = 0 \right)
      </me>
      when it is possible to write For each real number <m>x</m>,
      there exists a real number <m>y</m> such that <m>x + y = 0</m>, or,
      more succinctly
      (if appropriate),
      Every real number has an additive inverse.

          Using the definition of a prime number,

          Also, 4 is a composite number since
          <m>4 = 2 \cdot 2</m>; 10 is a composite number since <m>10 = 2 \cdot 5</m>;
