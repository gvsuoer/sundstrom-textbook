      Number theory is a study of the system of integers,

      which consists of the set of integers,
      <m>\mathbb{Z} = \left\{ {\, \ldots , - 3, - 2, - 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \, } \right\}</m> and the various properties of this set under the usual operations of addition and multiplication and under the usual ordering relation of
      <q>less than.</q>
      The properties of the integers in <xref ref="Ta_axiomsforintegers"></xref>
      will be considered axioms in this text.

      We have already studied a good deal of number theory in this text in our discussion of proof methods.
      In particular, we have studied even and odd integers,
      divisibility of integers, congruence,
      and the Division Algorithm.
      See the summary for <xref ref="C_proofs"></xref>
      on <xref ref="SS_evenodd"></xref>
      for a summary of results concerning even and odd integers as well as results concerning properties of divisors.
      We reviewed some of these properties and the Division Algorithm in the beginning activities.

  <subsection>
    <title>The Greatest Common Divisor</title>
    <p>
      One of the most important concepts in elementary number theory is that of the greatest common divisor of two integers.
      The definition for the greatest common divisor of two integers
      (not both zero)
      was given in <xref ref="PA_gcd"></xref>.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>a, b \in \mathbb{Z}</m> and <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are not both 0, and if <m>d \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
            then <m>d = \gcd( {a, b} )</m> provided that it satisfies all of the following properties:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>d \mid a</m> and <m>d \mid b</m>.
                  That is, <m>d</m> is a common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>k</m> is a natural number such that <m>k \mid a</m> and
                  <m>k \mid b</m>, then <m>k \leq d</m>.
                  That is, any other common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is less than or equal to <m>d</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Consequently,
            a natural number <m>d</m> is not the greatest common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> provided that it does not satisfy at least one of these properties.
            That is, <m>d</m> is not equal to <m>\gcd( {a, b} )</m> provided that
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>d</m> does not divide <m>a</m> or <m>d</m> does not divide <m>b</m>; or
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  There exists a natural number <m>k</m> such that
                  <m>k \mid a</m> and <m>k \mid b</m> and <m>k > d</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          This means that <m>d</m> is not the greatest common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> provided that it is not a common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> or that there exists a common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> that is greater than <m>d</m>.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning activities,
      we determined the greatest common divisors for several pairs of integers.
      The process we used was to list all the divisors of both integers,
      then list all the common divisors of both integers and, finally,
      from the list of all common divisors,
      find the greatest (largest) common divisor.
      This method works reasonably well for small integers but can get quite cumbersome if the integers are large.
      Before we develop an efficient method for determining the greatest common divisor of two integers,
      we need to establish some properties of greatest common divisors.
    </p>
    <p>
      One property was suggested in <xref ref="PA_gcd"></xref>.
      If we look at the results in Part<nbsp/><xref ref="PA_gcd5"/> of that beginning activity,
      we should observe that any common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> will divide <m>\gcd( {a, b} )</m>.
      In fact, the primary goals of the remainder of this section are
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            To find an efficient method for determining <m>\gcd( {a, b} )</m>,
            where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are integers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To prove that the natural number
            <m>\gcd( {a, b} )</m> is the only natural number <m>d</m> that satisfies the following properties:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>d</m> divides <m>a</m> and <m>d</m> divides <m>b</m>; and
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  if <m>k</m> is a natural number such that <m>k \mid a</m> and
                  <m>k \mid b</m>, then <m>k \mid d</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      The second goal is only slightly different from the definition of the greatest common divisor.
      The only difference is in the second condition where
      <m>k \leq d</m> is replaced by <m>k \mid d</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will first consider the case where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are integers with <m>a \ne 0</m> and <m>b > 0</m>.
      The proof of the result stated in the second goal contains a method
      (called the Euclidean Algorithm)
      for determining the greatest common divisor of the two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
      The main idea of the method is to keep replacing the pair of integers
      <m>\left( {a, b} \right)</m> with another pair of integers <m>\left( {b, r} \right)</m>,
      where <m>0 \leq r \lt b</m> and <m>\gcd ( {b, r} ) = \gcd ( {a, b} )</m>.
      This idea was explored in <xref ref="PA_gcdanddivalgo"></xref>.
      <xref ref="L_gcdanddivalgo">Lemma</xref>
      is a conjecture that could have been formulated in <xref ref="PA_gcdanddivalgo"></xref>.

        Let <m>c</m> and <m>d</m> be integers, not both equal to zero.
        Assume that <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> are integers such that <m>c = d \cdot q + r</m>.
        For ease of notation, we will let
        <me>
          m = \gcd( {c, d} )\text{  and  }  n = \gcd( {d, r} )
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, <m>m</m> divides <m>c</m> and <m>m</m> divides <m>d</m>.
        Consequently,
        there exist integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>c = mx</m> and <m>d = my</m>.
        Hence,
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}r \amp = c - d \cdot q \\ r \amp = mx - ( {my} )q \\ r \amp = m ( {x - yq} ). \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        But this means that <m>m</m> divides <m>r</m>.
        Since <m>m</m> divides <m>d</m> and <m>m</m> divides <m>r</m>,
        <m>m</m> is less than or equal to <m>\gcd( {d, r} )</m>.
        Thus, <m>m \leq n</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using a similar argument,
        we see that <m>n</m> divides <m>d</m> and <m>n</m> divides <m>r</m>.
        Since <m>c = d \cdot q + r</m>,
        we can prove that <m>n</m> divides <m>c</m>.
        Hence, <m>n</m> divides <m>c</m> and <m>n</m> divides <m>d</m>.
        Thus, <m>n \leq \gcd( {c, d} )</m> or <m>n \leq m</m>.
        We now have <m>m \leq n</m> and <m>n \leq m</m>.
        Hence, <m>m = n</m> and <m>\gcd( {c, d} ) = \gcd( {d, r} )</m>.

        We completed several examples illustrating <xref ref="L_gcdanddivalgo">Lemma</xref>

        For another example, let <m>c = 56</m> and <m>d = 12</m>.

      The example in <xref ref="prog_lemma81"></xref>
      illustrates the main idea of the
      <em>Euclidean Algorithm</em>
          <idx><h>Euclidean Algorithm</h></idx>
      for finding <m>\gcd( {a, b} )</m>,
      which is explained in the proof of the following theorem.

            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be integers with <m>a \ne 0</m> and <m>b > 0</m>,
        and let <m>d = \gcd( {a, b} )</m>.
        By the Division Algorithm,
        there exist integers <m>q_1</m> and <m>r_1</m> such that
        <men xml:id="eq_euclidalgo1">
          a = b \cdot q_1  + r_1 \text{ ,  and  } 0 \leq r_1  \lt  b
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>r_1 = 0</m>,
        then equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_euclidalgo1"/> implies that <m>b</m> divides <m>a</m>.
        Hence, <m>b = d = \gcd( {a, b} )</m> and this number satisfies <xref ref="T_euclidalgo1">Conditions</xref>
        and <xref ref="T_euclidalgo2"></xref>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>r_1  > 0</m>, then by <xref ref="L_gcdanddivalgo">Lemma</xref>,
        <m>\gcd( {a, b} ) = \gcd( {b, r_1 } )</m>.
        We use the Division Algorithm again to obtain integers <m>q_2</m> and <m>r_2</m> such that
        <men xml:id="eq_euclidalgo2">
          b = r_1  \cdot q_2  + r_2 \text{ ,  and  } 0 \leq r_2  \lt  r_1
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>r_2 = 0</m>,
        then equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_euclidalgo2"/> implies that <m>r_1</m> divides <m>b</m>.
        This means that <m>r_1 = \gcd( {b, r_1 } )</m>.
        But we have already seen that <m>\gcd( {a, b} ) = \gcd( {b, r_1 } )</m>.
        Hence, <m>r_1 = \gcd( {a, b} )</m>.
        In addition,
        if <m>k</m> is an integer that divides both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, then,
        using equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_euclidalgo1"/>,
        we see that <m>r_1 = a - b \cdot q_1</m> and,
        hence <m>k</m> divides <m>r_1</m>.
        This shows that <m>r_1 = \gcd( {a, b} )</m> satisfies <xref ref="T_euclidalgo1">Conditions</xref>
        and <xref ref="T_euclidalgo2"></xref>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>r_2 > 0</m>, then by <xref ref="L_gcdanddivalgo">Lemma</xref>,
        <m>\gcd( {b, r_1 } ) = \gcd( {r_1 , r_2 } )</m>.
        But we have already seen that <m>\gcd( {a, b} ) = \gcd( {b, r_1 } )</m>.
        Hence, <m>\gcd( {a, b} ) = \gcd( {r_1 , r_2 } )</m>.
        We now continue to apply the Division Algorithm to produce a sequence of pairs of integers
        (all of which have the same greatest common divisor).
        This is summarized in the following table:

        From the inequalities in the third column of this table,

      <p>
        Remember that this table was constructed by repeated use of <xref ref="L_gcdanddivalgo">Lemma</xref>
        and that the greatest common divisor of each pair of integers produced equals <m>\gcd( {a, b} )</m>.
        Also, the last row in the table indicates that <m>r_p</m> divides <m>r_{p - 1}</m>.
        This means that <m>\gcd( {r_{p - 1} , r_p } ) = r_p</m> and hence <m>r_p = \gcd( {a, b} )</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This proves that <m>r_p = \gcd( {a, b} )</m> satisfies <xref ref="T_euclidalgo1">Condition</xref> of this theorem.
        Now assume that <m>k</m> is an integer such that <m>k</m> divides <m>a</m> and <m>k</m> divides <m>b</m>.
        We proceed through the table row by row.
        First, since <m>r_1 = a - b \cdot q</m>,
        we see that <m>k</m> must divide <m>r_1</m>.
        The second row tells us that <m>r_2 = b - r_1 \cdot q_2</m>.
        Since <m>k</m> divides <m>b</m> and <m>k</m> divides <m>r_1</m>,
        we conclude that <m>k</m> divides <m>r_2</m>.
        Continuing with each row,
        we see that <m>k</m> divides each of the remainders <m>r_1</m>,
        <m>r_2</m>,
        <m>r_3</m>, <m>\ldots, r_p</m>.
        This means that <m>r_p = \gcd( {a, b} )</m> satisfies <xref ref="T_euclidalgo2">Condition</xref> of the theorem.

      We will use <xref ref="E_euclidalgo">Example</xref>

      It is possible to use the steps of the Euclidean Algorithm in reverse order to write

      We can use Step 3 to write
      <m>r_3 = \gcd( {a, b} )</m> as a linear combination of <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m>.
      We can then solve the equation in Step 2 for <m>r_2</m> and use this to write
      <m>r_3 = \gcd( {a, b} )</m> as a linear combination of <m>r_1</m> and <m>b</m>.
      We can then use the equation in Step 1 to solve for <m>r_1</m> and use this to write
      <m>r_3 = \gcd( {a, b} )</m> as a linear combination of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.

      In general, if we can write
      <m>r_p = \gcd( {a, b} )</m> as a linear combination of a pair in a given row,
      then we can use the equation in the preceding step to write
      <m>r_p = \gcd( {a, b} )</m> as a linear combination of the pair in this preceding row.

      The notational details of this induction argument get quite involved.
      Many mathematicians prefer to prove <xref ref="T_gcdaslincomb"></xref>
      using a property of the natural numbers called the Well-Ordering Principle.
      <em>The Well-Ordering Principle</em>
          <idx><h>Well Ordering Principle</h></idx>
      for the natural numbers states that any nonempty set of natural numbers must contain a least element.
      It can be proven that the Well-Ordering Principle is equivalent to the Principle of Mathematical Induction.

                Complete the proof of this proposition if you have not already done so.
                <em><xref ref="P_divlinearcomb">Proposition</xref></em>
                <em>Let a, b, and t be integers with <m>t \ne 0</m>.
                If t divides a and t divides b, then for all integers x and y, t divides \text{(} ax + by\text{)} .</em>
                <em>Proof</em>.
                Let <m>a</m>,
                <m>b</m>, and <m>t</m> be integers with <m>t \ne 0</m>,
                and assume that <m>t</m> divides <m>a</m> and <m>t</m> divides <m>b</m>.
                We will prove that for all integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
                <m>t</m> divides <m>(ax + by)</m>.
                So let <m>x \in \mathbb{Z}</m> and let <m>y \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
                Since <m>t</m> divides <m>a</m>,
                there exists an integer <m>m</m> such that <m>\ldots </m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                Now let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be integers, not both zero,
                and let <m>d = \gcd(a, b )</m>.
                <xref ref="T_gcdaslincomb"></xref>
                states that <m>d</m> is a linear combination of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
                In addition, let <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> be the following sets:
                <me>
                  S = \left\{ ax + by \mid x, y \in \Z \right\} \qquad \text{ and }  \qquad T = \left\{ kd \mid k \in \Z \right\}\!
                </me>.
                That is, <m>S</m> is the set of all linear combinations of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
                and <m>T</m> is the set of all multiples of the greatest common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
                Does the set <m>S</m> equal the set <m>T</m>?
                If not, is one of these sets a subset of the other set?
                Justify your conclusions.  \note In Parts (c) and (d),
                we were exploring special cases for these two sets.
