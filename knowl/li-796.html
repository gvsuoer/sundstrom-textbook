</h2>
<p>The statement should be a simple declarative statement of the problem. Do not simply rewrite the problem as stated in the textbook or given on a handout. Problems often begin with phrases such as “Show that” or “Prove that.” This should be reworded as a simple declarative statement of the theorem. Then skip a line and write “Proof” in italics or boldface font (when using a word processor). Begin the proof on the same line. Make sure that all paragraphs can be easily identified. Skipping a line between paragraphs or indenting each paragraph can accomplish this.</p>
<p>As an example, an exercise in a text might read, “Prove that if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an odd integer, then <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> is an odd integer.” This could be started as follows: <blockquote class="blockquote">Theorem. If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an odd integer, then <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> is an odd integer.</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">Proof: We assume that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an odd integer ….</blockquote></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="C_writingguides.html#li-796" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
