<p>When proving a biconditional statement using the logical equivalency <span class="process-math">\(\left( {P \leftrightarrow Q} \right) \equiv \left( {P \to Q} \right) \wedge \left( {Q \to P} 
\right)\text{,}\)</span> we actually need to prove two conditional statements. The proof of each conditional statement can be considered as one of two parts of the proof of the biconditional statement. Make sure that the start and end of each of these parts is indicated clearly. This is illustrated in the proof of the following proposition. <article class="proposition theorem-like"><h4 class="heading">
<span class="type">Proposition</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.12</span><span class="period">.</span>
</h4>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(x \in \mathbb{R}\text{.}\)</span> The real number <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> equals 2 if and only if <span class="process-math">\(x^3 - 2x^2 + x = 2\text{.}\)</span></p></article> <article class="proof"><h4 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h4>
<p>We will prove this biconditional statement by proving the following two conditional statements:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>For each real number <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> equals 2 , then <span class="process-math">\(x^3 - 2x^2 + x = 2\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>For each real number <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(x^3 - 2x^2 + x = 2\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> equals 2.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the first part, we assume <span class="process-math">\(x = 2\)</span> and prove that <span class="process-math">\(x^3  - 2x^2  + x = 2\text{.}\)</span> We can do this by substituting <span class="process-math">\(x = 2\)</span> into the expression <span class="process-math">\(x^3  - 2x^2  + x\text{.}\)</span> This gives</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
x^3  - 2x^2  + x \amp = 2^3  - 2\left( {2^2 } \right) + 2\\
\amp = 8 - 8 + 2\\
\amp =2\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">This completes the first part of the proof.</p>
<p>For the second part, we assume that <span class="process-math">\(x^3  - 2x^2  + x = 2\)</span> and from this assumption, we will prove that <span class="process-math">\(x = 2\text{.}\)</span> We will do this by solving this equation for <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> To do so, we first rewrite the equation <span class="process-math">\(x^3  - 2x^2  + x = 2\)</span> by subtracting 2 from both sides:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x^3  - 2x^2  + x - 2 = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We can now factor the left side of this equation by factoring an <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> from the first two terms and then factoring <span class="process-math">\(\left( {x - 2} \right)\)</span> from the resulting two terms. This is shown below.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
x^3  - 2x^2  + x - 2 \amp = 0\\
x^2 \left( {x - 2} \right) + \left( {x - 2} \right) \amp = 0\\
\left( {x - 2} \right)\left( {x^2  + 1} \right) \amp = 0\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Now, in the real numbers, if a product of two factors is equal to zero, then one of the factors must be zero. So this last equation implies that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x - 2 = 0\text{ or } x^2  + 1 = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The equation <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + 1 = 0\)</span> has no real number solution. So since <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a real number, the only possibility is that <span class="process-math">\(x - 2 = 0\text{.}\)</span> From this we can conclude that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> must be equal to 2.</p>
<p>Since we have now proven both conditional statements, we have proven that <span class="process-math">\(x = 2\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(x^3 - 2x^2 + x = 2\text{.}\)</span></p></article></p>
