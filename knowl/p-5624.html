<p>In <a href="S_finitesets.html#PA_equivalentsets" class="internal" title="Beginning Activity: Beginning Activity 1: Equivalent Sets, Part 1">Beginning Activity 1</a>, we introduced the concept of equivalent sets. The motivation for this definition was to have a formal method for determining whether or not two sets “have the same number of elements.” This idea was described in terms of a one-to-one correspondence (a bijection) from one set onto the other set. This idea may seem simple for finite sets, but as we will see, this idea has surprising consequences when we deal with infinite sets. (We will soon provide precise definitions for finite and infinite sets.)</p>
