          This statement is true.
          Use a proof by contradiction.
          So assume that there exist integers  <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> such that <m>a</m> is even,
          <m>b</m> is odd,
          and 4 divides <m>a^2 + b^2</m>.
          So there exist integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> such that
          <me>
            a = 2m \qquad \text{ and }  \qquad a^2 + b^2 = 4n
          </me>.
          Substitute <m>a = 2m</m> into the second equation and use algebra to rewrite in the form <m>b^2 = 4(n - m^2)</m>.
          This means that <m>b^2</m> is even and hence, that <m>b</m> is even.
          This is a contradiction to the assumption that <m>b</m> is odd.

          So assume that there exist integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> such that  <m>a</m> is even,
          <m>b</m> is odd,
          and 6 divides <m>a^2 + b^2</m>.
          So there exist integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> such that

            a = 2m \qquad \text{ and }  \qquad a^2 + b^2 = 6n

          Substitute <m>a = 2m</m> into the second equation and use algebra to rewrite in the form <m>b^2 = 2(3n - 2m^2)</m>.
          This means that <m>b^2</m> is even and hence, that <m>b</m> is even.
          This is a contradiction.

          This statement is true.
          Use a direct proof.
          Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be integers and assume they are odd.
          So there exist integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> such that
          <me>
            a = 2m + 1 \qquad \text{ and }  \qquad b = 2n + 1
          </me>.
          We then see that
          <md>
            <mrow>a^2 + 3b^2 \amp = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 + 12n^2 + 12n + 3</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 4\left( m^2 + m + 3n^2 + 3n + 1 \right)</mrow>
          </md>.
          This shows that 4 divides <m>a^2 + 3b^2</m>.

      \item Do not attempt to mimic the proof that the square root of 2 is irrational
      (<xref ref="T_squareroot2">Theorem</xref>).  You should still use the definition of a rational number but then use the fact that  <m>\sqrt {18}  = \sqrt {9 \cdot 2}  = \sqrt 9 \sqrt 2  = 3\sqrt 2</m>.  So, if we assume that <m>r = \sqrt{18} = 3 \sqrt{2}</m> is rational, then <m>\dfrac{r}{3} = \dfrac{\sqrt{18}}{3}</m> is rational since the rational numbers are closed under division.  Hence, <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is rational and this is a contradiction to <xref ref="T_squareroot2">Theorem</xref>.

          Use a proof by contradiction.
          So, we assume that there exist real numbers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>x</m> is rational,
          <m>y</m> is irrational, and <m>x + y</m> is rational.
          Since the rational numbers are closed under addition,
          this implies that <m>\left( x + y \right) - x</m> is a rational number.
          Since <m>\left( x + y \right) - x = y</m>,
          we conclude that <m>y</m> is a rational number and this contradicts the assumption that <m>y</m> is irrational.

          Use a proof by contradiction.
          So, we assume that there exist nonzero real numbers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>x</m> is rational,
          <m>y</m> is irrational, and <m>xy</m> is rational.
          Since the rational numbers are closed under division by nonzero rational numbers,
          this implies that <m>\dfrac{xy}{x}</m> is a rational number.
          Since <m>\dfrac{xy}{x} = y</m>,
          we conclude that <m>y</m> is a rational number and this contradicts the assumption that <m>y</m> is irrational.
