      In the two beginning activities,

      In such instances, we give the equation a special name.

      Diophantine equations are named in honor of the Greek mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria <idx><h>Diophantus of Alexandria</h></idx>
      (third century {\smallc c.e.}).
      Very little is known about Diophantus' life except that he probably lived in Alexandria in the early part of the fourth century {\smallc c.e.} and was probably the first to use letters for unknown quantities in arithmetic problems.
      His most famous work, <em>Arithmetica</em>,
      consists of approximately 130 problems and their solutions.
      Most of these problems involved solutions of equations in various numbers of variables.
      It is interesting to note that Diophantus did not restrict his solutions to the integers but recognized rational number solutions as well.
      Today, however,
      the solutions for a so-called Diophantine equation must be integers.

      The equations that were investigated in <xref ref="exploringlinear"></xref>
      were linear Diophantine equations in two variables.
      The problem of determining all the solutions of a linear Diophantine equation has been completely solved.
      Before stating the general result,
      we will provide a few more examples.

        <p>
          We can use substitution to verify that <m>x = 2</m> and <m>y = -1</m> is a solution of the linear Diophantine equation

          It would be nice to determine the pattern that these solutions exhibit.
          If we consider the solution <m>x = 2</m> and <m>y =-1</m> to be the
          <q>starting point,</q>
          then we can see that the other solutions are obtained by adding 3 to <m>x</m> and subtracting 4 from <m>y</m> in the previous solution.
          So we can write these solutions to the equation as
          <me>
            x = 2 + 3k \qquad \text{ and }  \qquad y = -1 - 4k
          </me>,
          where <m>k</m> is an integer.
          We can use substitution and algebra to verify that these expressions for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> give solutions of this equation as follows:
          <md>
            <mrow>4x + 3y \amp = 4 \left( 2+3k \right) + 3 \left( -1-4k \right)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \left( 8 + 12k \right) + \left( -3 - 12k \right)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 5</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should note that we have not yet proved that these solutions are all of the solutions of the Diophantine equation <m>4x + 3y = 5</m>.
          This will be done later.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the general form for a linear Diophantine equation is <m>ax + by = c</m>,
          then for this example, <m>a = 4</m> and <m>b = 3</m>.
          Notice that for this equation,
          we started with one solution and obtained other solutions by adding <m>b = 3</m> to <m>x</m> and subtracting <m>a = 4</m> from <m>y</m> in the previous solution.
          Also, notice that <m>\gcd( 3, 4 ) = 1</m>.

    <proof>
      <p>
        The proof of Part<nbsp/><xref ref="T_lindiop2-1"/> is Exercise<nbsp/><xref ref="exer_lindioph2"/>.
        For Part<nbsp/><xref ref="T_lindiop2-2"/>, we let <m>a</m>,
        <m>b</m>,
        and <m>c</m> be integers with <m>a \ne 0</m> and <m>b \ne 0</m>,
        and let <m>d = \gcd( a,b )</m>.
        We also assume that <m>d \mid c</m>.
        Since <m>d = \gcd( a,b )</m>,
        <xref ref="T_gcdaslincomb">Theorem</xref>
        tells us that <m>d</m> is a linear combination of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
        So there exist integers <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> such that
        <men xml:id="eq_lindioph1">
          d = as + bt
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>d \mid c</m>,
        there exists an integer <m>m</m> such that <m>c = dm</m>.
        We can now multiply both sides of equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_lindioph1"/> by <m>m</m> and obtain
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}dm \amp = ( {as + bt} ) m \\ c \amp = a( sm ) + b( tm ). \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that <m>x = sm</m>,
        <m>y = tm</m> is a solution of <m>ax + by = c</m>,
        and we have proved that the Diophantine equation
        <m>ax + by = c</m> has at least one solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let <m>x = x_0</m>,
        <m>y = y_0</m> be any particular solution of <m>ax + by = c</m>,
        let <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, and let
        <men xml:id="eq_x0andy0">
          x = x_0 + \frac{b}{d} k  \qquad  y = y_0 - \frac{a}{d} k
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now verify that for each <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
        the equations in<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_x0andy0"/> produce a solution of <m>ax + by = c</m>.
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}ax + by \amp = a \!\left( {x_0 + \frac{b}{d} k } \right) + b \!\left( {y_0 - \frac{a}{d} k} \right ) \\ \amp = a x_0 + \frac{ab}{d} k + b y_0 - \frac{ab}{d} k \\ \amp = a x_0 + b y_0 \\ \amp = c. \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This proves that the Diophantine equation
        <m>ax + by = c</m> has infinitely many solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now show that every solution of this equation can be written in the form described in<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_x0andy0"/>.
        So suppose that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are integers such that <m>ax + by = c</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          ( {ax + by} ) - ( {ax_0 + by_0} ) = c - c = 0
        </me>,
        and this equation can be rewritten in the following form:
        <men xml:id="eq_dioph3">
          a( {x - x_0} ) = b( {y_0 - y} )
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dividing both sides of this equation by <m>d</m>, we obtain
        <me>
          \left( \frac{a}{d} \right) \left( {x - x_0} \right ) = \left( \frac{b}{d} \right) \left( {y_0 - y} \right)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This implies that
        <me>
          \frac{a}{d} \text{ divides }  \left( \frac{b}{d} \right) ( {y_0 - y} )
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, by Exercise<nbsp/><xref ref="exer_dividebygcd"/> in <xref ref="S_primefactorizations"></xref>,
        <m>\gcd \!\left( \dfrac{a}{d}, \dfrac{b}{d} \right) = 1</m>,
        and so by <xref ref="T_relativelyprimeprop">Theorem</xref>,
        we can conclude that <m>\dfrac{a}{d}</m> divides <m>\left( {y_0 - y} \right)</m>.
        This means that there exists an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>y_0 - y = \dfrac{a}{d} k</m>,
        and solving for <m>y</m> gives
        <me>
          y = y_0 - \frac{a}{d} k
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Substituting this value for <m>y</m> in equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_dioph3"/> and solving for <m>x</m> yields
        <me>
          x = x_0 + \frac{b}{d} k
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This proves that every solution of the Diophantine equation
        <m>ax + by = c</m> can be written in the form prescribed in<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_x0andy0"/>.

          <em>Linear Congruences in One Variable</em>.
          Let <m>n</m> be a natural number and let <m>a,
          b \in \mathbb{Z}</m> with <m>a \ne 0</m>.

This is called a linear congruence since the variable <m>x</m> occurs to the first power.
          A <em>solution of a linear congruence in one variable</em>

          A solution is an integer that makes the resulting congruence true when the integer is substituted for the variable <m>x</m>.

        The following parts of this activity show that we can use the results of <xref ref="T_lindioph2">Theorem</xref> to help find all solutions of the linear congruence <m>6x \equiv 4 \pmod 8</m>.

              This can be used to generate solutions for <m>x</m> and the variable introduced in part<nbsp/><xref ref="lincongruence3"/>.
