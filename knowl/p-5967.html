<p>We have now seen that any open interval of real numbers is uncountable and has cardinality <span class="process-math">\(\boldsymbol{c}\text{.}\)</span> In addition, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is uncountable and has cardinality <span class="process-math">\(\boldsymbol{c}\text{.}\)</span> Now, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/C_cantor.html" title="Corollary 9.33">Corollary 9.33</a> tells us that <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} )\)</span> is uncountable. A question that can be asked is, “Does <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} )\)</span> have the same cardinality as <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\text{?}\)</span>” The answer is yes, although we are not in a position to prove it yet. A proof of this fact uses the following theorem, which is known as the Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein Theorem.</p>

<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> be sets. If there exist injections <span class="process-math">\(f\x A \to B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\x B \to A\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(A \approx B\text{.}\)</span></p></article><p>In the statement of this theorem, notice that it is not required that the function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> be the inverse of the function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> We will not prove the Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein Theorem here. The following items will show some uses of this important theorem.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein Theorem can also be used to prove that the closed interval <span class="process-math">\([ 0, 1 ]\)</span> is equivalent to the open interval <span class="process-math">\(( 0, 1 )\text{.}\)</span> See <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exer_closedinterval.html" title="Exercise 6">Exercise 6</a>.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Another question that was posed earlier is, “Are there other infinite cardinal numbers other than <span class="process-math">\(\aleph_0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\boldsymbol{c}\text{?}\)</span>” Again, the answer is yes, and the basis for this is Cantor's Theorem (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_cantor.html" title="Theorem 9.32: Cantor's Theorem">Theorem 9.32</a>). We can start with <span class="process-math">\(\text{ card} ( \mathbb{N} ) = \aleph_0\text{.}\)</span> We then define the following infinite cardinal numbers:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/T_cantor.html">
\begin{align*}
\amp \text{ card} ( \mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} ) ) = \alpha_1 \amp \amp
\text{ card} ( \mathcal{P} ( \mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} ) ) ) = \alpha_2\\
\amp \text{ card} ( \mathcal{P} ( \mathcal{P} ( \mathcal{P} 
( \mathbb{N} ) ) ) ) = \alpha_3 \amp \amp \vdots
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Cantor's Theorem tells us that these are all different cardinal numbers, and so we are just using the lowercase Greek letter <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> (alpha) to help give names to these cardinal numbers. In fact, although we will not define it here, there is a way to “order” these cardinal numbers in such a way that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\aleph_0 \lt  \alpha_1 \lt  \alpha_2 \lt  \alpha_3 \lt  \cdots\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Keep in mind, however, that even though these are different cardinal numbers, Cantor's Theorem does not tell us that these are the only cardinal numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/sec94_comment1.html" title="Item 1">Comment 1</a>, we indicated that <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} )\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> have the same cardinality. Combining this with the notation in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/sec94_comment3.html" title="Item 3">Comment 3</a>, this means that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/sec94_comment1.html ./knowl/sec94_comment3.html">
\begin{equation*}
\alpha_1 = \boldsymbol{c}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">However, this does not necessarily mean that <span class="process-math">\(\boldsymbol{c}\)</span> is the “next largest” cardinal number after <span class="process-math">\(\aleph_0\text{.}\)</span> A reasonable question is, “Is there an infinite set with cardinality between <span class="process-math">\(\aleph_0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\boldsymbol{c}\text{?}\)</span>” Rewording this in terms of the real number line, the question is, “On the real number line, is there an infinite set of points that is not equivalent to the entire line and also not equivalent to the set of natural numbers?” This question was asked by Cantor, but he was unable to find any such set. He conjectured that no such set exists. That is, he conjectured that <span class="process-math">\(\boldsymbol{c}\)</span> is really the next cardinal number after <span class="process-math">\(\aleph_0\text{.}\)</span> This conjecture has come to be known as the <dfn class="terminology">Continuum Hypothesis</dfn>. Stated somewhat more formally, the Continuum Hypothesis is <blockquote class="blockquote">There is no set <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(\aleph_0 \lt  \text{ card}  ( X ) 
\lt  \boldsymbol{c}\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> The question of whether the Continuum Hypothesis is true or false is one of the most famous problems in modern mathematics.</p>
<p> Through the combined work of Kurt Gödel in the 1930s and Paul Cohen in 1963, it has been proved that the Continuum Hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved from the standard axioms of set theory. This means that either the Continuum Hypothesis or its negation can be added to the standard axioms of set theory without creating a contradiction.</p>
