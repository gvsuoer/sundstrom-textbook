<p>At the risk of oversimplification, doing mathematics can be considered to have two distinct stages. The first stage is to convince yourself that you have solved the problem or proved a conjecture. This stage is a creative one and is quite often how mathematics is actually done. The second equally important stage is to convince other people that you have solved the problem or proved the conjecture. This second stage often has little in common with the first stage in the sense that it does not really communicate the process by which you solved the problem or proved the conjecture. However, it is an important part of the process of communicating mathematical results to a wider audience.</p>
