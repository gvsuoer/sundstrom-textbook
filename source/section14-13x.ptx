          Some integers that are congruent to 2 modulo 4 are <m>-6, -2, 2, 6, 10</m>,
          and some integers that are congruent to 3 modulo 6 are:

          For this proposition,
          it is reasonable to try a proof by contradiction since the conclusion is stated as a negation.

        <p>
          <proof>
            <p>
              We will use a proof by contradiction.
              Let <m>n \in \mathbb{Z}</m> and assume that
              <m>n \equiv 2 \pmod 4</m> and that <m>n \equiv 3 \pmod 6</m>.
              Since <m>n \equiv 2 \pmod 4</m>,
              we know that 4 divides <m>n - 2</m>.
              Hence, there exists an integer <m>k</m> such that
              <men xml:id="eq_exploreproof1">
                n - 2 = 4k
              </men>.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can also use the assumption that
              <m>n \equiv 3 \pmod 6</m> to conclude that 6 divides <m>n - 3</m> and that there exists an integer <m>m</m> such that
              <men xml:id="eq_exploreproof2">
                n - 3 = 6m
              </men>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we now solve equations<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_exploreproof1"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_exploreproof2"/> for <m>n</m> and set the two expressions equal to each other,
              we obtain
              <me>
                4k + 2 = 6m + 3
              </me>.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, this equation can be rewritten as
              <me>
                2\left( {2k + 1} \right) = 2\left( {3m + 1} \right) + 1
              </me>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since <m>2k + 1</m> is an integer and <m>3m + 1</m> is an integer,
              this last equation is a contradiction since the left side is an even integer and the right side is an odd integer.
              Hence, we have proven that if <m>n \equiv 2 \pmod 4</m>,
              then <m>n\not \equiv 3 \pmod 6</m>.
            </p>
          </proof>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>x^2 + y^2 = (2m + 1)^2 + (2n + 1)^2 = 2 \left( 2m^2 + 2m + 2n^2 + 2n + 1 \right)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using algebra to rewrite the last equation, we obtain
          <me>
            4m^2 + 4m + 4n^2 + 4n + 2 = 4k^2
          </me>.
          If we divide both sides of this equation by 2, we see that <m>2m^2 + 2m + 2n^2 + 2n + 1 = 2k^2</m> or
          <me>
            2 \left(m^2 + m + n^2 + n \right) + 1 = 2k^2
          </me>.
          However, the left side of the last equation is an odd integer and the right side is an even integer.
          This is a contradiction,
          and so we have proved that for all integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
          if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are odd integers,
          then there does not exist an integer <m>z</m> such that <m>x^2 + y^2 = z^2</m>.
