<p>We have already seen examples of <dfn class="terminology">Pythagorean triples</dfn>, which are natural numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\text{.}\)</span> For example, 3, 4, and 5 form a Pythagorean triple as do 5, 12, and 13. One of the famous mathematicians of the 17th century was Pierre de Fermat (1601 â€” 1665). Fermat made an assertion that for each natural number <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(n \geq 3\text{,}\)</span> there are no positive integers <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(a^n + b^n = c^n\text{.}\)</span> This assertion was discovered in a margin of one of Fermat's books after his death, but Fermat provided no proof. He did, however, state that he had discovered a truly remarkable proof but the margin did not contain enough room for the proof.</p>
