    <title>Emphasis on Writing in Mathematics</title>
    <p>
      Following are some of the important features of this text that will help with the transition from 
      calculus to upper-level mathematics courses.
    </p>
      <p>
        Issues dealing with writing mathematical exposition are addressed throughout the book.
        Guidelines for writing mathematical proofs are incorporated into the book.
        These guidelines are introduced as needed and begin in <xref ref="S_direct"></xref>.
        <xref ref="C_writingguides"></xref>
        contains a summary of all the guidelines for writing mathematical proofs that are introduced 
        throughout the text.
        In addition,
        every attempt has been made to ensure that every completed proof presented in this text is 
        written according to these guidelines.
        This provides students with examples of well-written proofs.
      </p>
      <p>  
        One of the motivating factors for writing this book was to develop a textbook for the course
        <q>Communicating in Mathematics</q>
        at Grand Valley State University.
        This course is part of the university's Supplemental Writing Skills Program,
        and there was no text that dealt with writing issues in mathematics that was suitable for this course.
        This is why some of the writing guidelines in the text deal with the use of <latex/> or a word processor that is capable of producing the appropriate mathematical symbols and equations.
        However, the writing guidelines can easily be implemented for courses where students do not 
        have access to this type of word processing.

      <title>Instruction in the Process of Constructing Proofs</title>
        <p>
          One of the primary goals of this book is to develop students' abilities to construct 
          mathematical proofs.
          Another goal is to develop their abilities to write the proof in a coherent manner that 
          conveys an understanding of the proof to the reader.
          These are two distinct skills.
        </p>
        <p>  
          Instruction on how to write proofs begins in <xref ref="S_direct"></xref>
          and is developed further in <xref ref="C_proofs"></xref>.
          In addition, <xref ref="C_induction"></xref>
          is devoted to developing students' abilities to construct proofs using mathematical induction.
          Students are introduced to a method to organize their thought processes when attempting to 
          construct a proof that uses a so-called know-show table.
          (See <xref ref="S_direct"></xref>
          and <xref ref="S_directproof"></xref>.)
          Students use this table to work backward from what it is they are trying to prove while at 
          the same time working forward from the assumptions of the problem.
          The know-show tables are used quite extensively in <xref ref="C_intro"></xref>
          and <xref ref="C_proofs"></xref>.
          However, the explicit use of know-show tables is gradually reduced and these tables are rarely 
          used in the later chapters.
          One reason for this is that these tables may work well when there appears to be only one way of proving a certain result.
          As the proofs become more complicated or other methods of proof
          (such as proofs using cases)
          are used, these know-show tables become less useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the know-show tables are not to be considered an absolute necessity in using the text.
          However, they are useful for students beginning to learn how to construct and write proofs.
          They provide a convenient way for students to organize their work.
          More importantly,
          they introduce students to a way of thinking about a problem.
          Instead of immediately trying to write a complete proof,
          the know-show table forces students to stop,
          think, and ask questions such as 
          <blockquote>Just exactly what is it that I am trying to prove?</blockquote>
          <blockquote>How can I prove this?</blockquote> 
          <blockquote>What methods do I have that may allow me to prove this?</blockquote>
          <blockquote>What are the assumptions?</blockquote>
          <blockquote>How can I use these assumptions to prove the result?</blockquote>
          Being able to ask these questions is a big step in constructing a proof.
          The next task is to answer the questions and to use those answers to construct a proof.

      <title>Emphasis on Active Learning</title>

        <p>
          One of the underlying premises of this text is that the best way to learn and understand mathematics is to be actively involved in the learning process.
          However, it is unlikely that students will learn all the mathematics in a given course on their own.
          Students actively involved in learning mathematics need appropriate materials that will provide guidance and support in their learning of mathematics.
          There are several ways this text promotes active learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the exception of <xref ref="S_reviewproofs"></xref>,
          each section has exactly two beginning activities.
          These activities should be completed by the students prior to the classroom discussion of the section.
          The purpose of the beginning activities is to prepare students to participate in the classroom discussion of the section.
          Some of these activities will review prior mathematical work that is necessary for the new section.
          This prior work may contain material from previous mathematical courses or it may contain  material covered earlier in this text.
          Other beginning activities will introduce new concepts and definitions that will be used 
          when that section is discussed in class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several Progress Checks are included in each section.
          These are either short exercises or short activities designed to help the students determine if they are understanding the material as it is presented.
          Some progress checks are also intended to prepare the student for the next topic in the section.
          Answers to the Progress Checks are provided in <xref ref="C_progress"></xref>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Explorations and activities are included at the end of the exercises of each section.
          These activities can be done individually or in a collaborative learning setting,
          where students work in groups to brainstorm,
          make conjectures, test each other's ideas,
          reach consensus, and, it is hoped,
          develop sound mathematical arguments to support their work.
          These activities can also be assigned as homework in addition to the other exercises at 
          the end of each section.

      <title>Other Important Features of the Book</title>
        <p>
          Several sections of the text include exercises called Evaluation of Proofs.
          (The first such exercise appears in <xref provisional="section 3.1"/>)
          For these exercises, there is a proposed proof of a proposition.
          However, the proposition may be true or may be false.
          If a proposition is false, the proposed proof is, of course, incorrect,
          and the student is asked to find the error in the proof and then provide a counterexample showing that the proposition is false.
          However, if the proposition is true,
          the proof may be incorrect or not well written.
          In keeping with the emphasis on writing,
          students are then asked to correct the proof and/or provide a well-written proof according to the guidelines established in the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          To assist students with studying the material in the text,
          there is a summary at the end of each chapter.
          The summaries usually list the important definitions introduced in the chapter and the important results proven in the chapter.
          If appropriate,
          the summary also describes the important proof techniques discussed in the chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Answers or hints for several exercises are included in an appendix.
          This was done in response to suggestions from many students at Grand Valley and some students from other institutions who were using the book.
          In addition, those exercises with an answer or a hint in the appendix are preceded by a 
          star <m>\left( ^\star \right)</m>. <!-- Change this later? -->
