<p>We will use a proof by contradiction. So we assume that there exist real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is rational, <span class="process-math">\(x \ne 0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is irrational, and <span class="process-math">\(x \cdot y\)</span> is rational. Since <span class="process-math">\(x \ne 0\text{,}\)</span> we can divide by <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> and since the rational numbers are closed under division by nonzero rational numbers, we know that <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{1}{x} \in \Q\text{.}\)</span> We now know that <span class="process-math">\(x \cdot y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{1}{x}\)</span> are rational numbers and since the rational numbers are closed under multiplication, we conclude that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{x} \cdot \left( xy \right) \in \Q\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>However, <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{1}{x} \cdot \left( xy \right) = y\)</span> and hence, <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> must be a rational number. Since a real number cannot be both rational and irrational, this is a contradiction to the assumption that <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is irrational. We have therefore proved that for all real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is rational and <span class="process-math">\(x \ne 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is irrational, then <span class="process-math">\(x \cdot y\)</span> is irrational.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_contradiction.html#proof-12" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
