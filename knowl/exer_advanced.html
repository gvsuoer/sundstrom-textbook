<div class="introduction"><p>The following exercises contain definitions or results from more advanced mathematics courses. Even though we may not understand all of the terms involved, it is still possible to recognize the structure of the given statements and write a meaningful negation of that statement.</p></div>

<p>In abstract algebra, an operation <span class="process-math">\(*\)</span> on a set <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is called a <dfn class="terminology">commutative operation</dfn> provided that for all <span class="process-math">\(x, y \in A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x * y = y * x\text{.}\)</span> Carefully explain what it means to say that an operation <span class="process-math">\(*\)</span> on a set <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is not a commutative operation.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>In abstract algebra, a <dfn class="terminology">ring</dfn> consists of a nonempty set <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> and two operations called addition and multiplication. A nonzero element <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> in a ring <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is called a <em class="emphasis">zero divisor</em> provided that there exists a nonzero element <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(ab = 0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(ba = 0\text{.}\)</span> Carefully explain what it means to say that a nonzero element <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> in a ring <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is not a zero divisor.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>A set <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> of real numbers is called a <dfn class="terminology">neighborhood</dfn> of a real number <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> provided that there exists a positive real number <span class="process-math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> such that the open interval <span class="process-math">\((a - \varepsilon,
a + \varepsilon)\)</span> is contained in <span class="process-math">\(M\text{.}\)</span> Carefully explain what it means to say that a set <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is not a neighborhood of a real number <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<p>In advanced calculus, a sequence of real numbers <span class="process-math">\(\left(x_1, x_2, \ldots,
x_k, \ldots \right)\)</span> is called a <dfn class="terminology">Cauchy sequence</dfn> provided that for each positive real number <span class="process-math">\(\varepsilon\text{,}\)</span> there exists a natural number <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> such that for all <span class="process-math">\(m,
n \in \N\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(m &gt; N\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n &gt; N\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\left| x_n - x_m \right| \lt \varepsilon\text{.}\)</span> Carefully explain what it means to say that the sequence of real numbers <span class="process-math">\(\left(x_1, x_2, \ldots,
x_k, \ldots \right)\)</span> is not a Cauchy sequence.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_2quantifier.html#exer_advanced" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
