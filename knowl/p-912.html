<p>In <a href="S_1prop.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.1: Statements and Conditional Statements">SectionÂ 1.1</a>, we studied some of the closure properties of the standard number systems. (See <a href="S_1prop.html#SS_closure" class="internal" title="Subsection: Closure Properties of Number Systems">Closure Properties of Number Systems</a>.) We can extend this idea to other sets of numbers. So we say that:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>A set <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> of numbers is <dfn class="terminology">closed under addition</dfn> provided that whenever <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are in the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x + y\)</span> is in the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>A set <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> of numbers is <dfn class="terminology">closed under multiplication</dfn> provided that whenever <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are are in the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x \cdot y\)</span> is in the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>A set <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> of numbers is <dfn class="terminology">closed under subtraction</dfn> provided that whenever <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are are in the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x - y\)</span> is in the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">For each of the following sets, make a conjecture about whether or not it is closed under addition and whether or not it is closed under multiplication. In some cases, you may be able to find a counterexample that will prove the set is not closed under one of these operations.</p>
