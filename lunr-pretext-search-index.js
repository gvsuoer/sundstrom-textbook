  "body": "Preface \n\n       Mathematical Reasoning: Writing and Proof \n      is designed to be a text for the first course in the college mathematics curriculum that \n      introduces students to the processes of constructing and writing proofs and focuses on the \n      formal development of mathematics.\n      The primary goals of the text are to help students:\n       \n           \n            Develop logical thinking skills and to develop the ability to think more abstractly in a proof oriented setting.\n           \n         \n           \n            Develop the ability to construct and write mathematical proofs using standard methods of mathematical proof including direct proofs,\n            proof by contradiction,\n            mathematical induction, case analysis, and counterexamples.\n           \n         \n           \n            Develop the ability to read and understand written mathematical proofs.\n           \n         \n           \n            Develop talents for creative thinking and problem solving.\n           \n         \n           \n            Improve their quality of communication in mathematics.\n            This includes improving writing techniques,\n            reading comprehension, and oral communication in mathematics.\n           \n         \n           \n            Better understand the nature of mathematics and its language.\n           \n         \n     \n      Another important goal of this text is to provide students with material that will be needed for \n      their further study of mathematics.\n     \n      This type of course has now become a standard part of the mathematics major at many colleges and universities.\n      It is often referred to as a\n       transition course \n      from the calculus sequence to the upper-level courses in the major.\n      The transition is from the problem-solving orientation of calculus to the more abstract and \n      theoretical upper-level courses.\n      This is needed today because many students complete their study of calculus without seeing a \n      formal proof or having constructed a proof of their own.\n      This is in contrast to many upper-level mathematics courses,\n      where the emphasis is on the formal development of abstract mathematical ideas,\n      and the expectations are that students will be able to read and understand proofs and be able to construct and write coherent,\n      understandable mathematical proofs.\n      Students should be able to use this text with a background of one semester of calculus.\n     Important Features of the Book \n        Following are some of the important features of this text that will help with the transition from \n        calculus to upper-level mathematics courses.\n         \n             Emphasis on Writing in Mathematics \n             \n              Issues dealing with writing mathematical exposition are addressed throughout the book.\n              Guidelines for writing mathematical proofs are incorporated into the book.\n              These guidelines are introduced as needed and begin in  .\n               \n              contains a summary of all the guidelines for writing mathematical proofs that are introduced \n              throughout the text.\n              In addition,\n              every attempt has been made to ensure that every completed proof presented in this text is \n              written according to these guidelines.\n              This provides students with examples of well-written proofs.\n             \n               \n              One of the motivating factors for writing this book was to develop a textbook for the course\n               Communicating in Mathematics \n              at Grand Valley State University.\n              This course is part of the university's Supplemental Writing Skills Program,\n              and there was no text that dealt with writing issues in mathematics that was suitable for this course.\n              This is why some of the writing guidelines in the text deal with the use of  latex  or a word processor that is capable of producing the appropriate mathematical symbols and equations.\n              However, the writing guidelines can easily be implemented for courses where students do not \n              have access to this type of word processing.\n             \n           \n             Instruction in the Process of Constructing Proofs \n               \n                One of the primary goals of this book is to develop students' abilities to construct \n                mathematical proofs.\n                Another goal is to develop their abilities to write the proof in a coherent manner that \n                conveys an understanding of the proof to the reader.\n                These are two distinct skills.\n               \n                 \n                Instruction on how to write proofs begins in  \n                and is developed further in  .\n                In addition,  \n                is devoted to developing students' abilities to construct proofs using mathematical induction.\n                Students are introduced to a method to organize their thought processes when attempting to \n                construct a proof that uses a so-called know-show table.\n                (See  \n                and  .)\n                Students use this table to work backward from what it is they are trying to prove while at \n                the same time working forward from the assumptions of the problem.\n                The know-show tables are used quite extensively in  \n                and  .\n                However, the explicit use of know-show tables is gradually reduced and these tables are rarely \n                used in the later chapters.\n                One reason for this is that these tables may work well when there appears to be only one way of proving a certain result.\n                As the proofs become more complicated or other methods of proof\n                (such as proofs using cases)\n                are used, these know-show tables become less useful.\n               \n               \n                So the know-show tables are not to be considered an absolute necessity in using the text.\n                However, they are useful for students beginning to learn how to construct and write proofs.\n                They provide a convenient way for students to organize their work.\n                More importantly,\n                they introduce students to a way of thinking about a problem.\n                Instead of immediately trying to write a complete proof,\n                the know-show table forces students to stop,\n                think, and ask questions such as \n                 Just exactly what is it that I am trying to prove? \n                 How can I prove this?  \n                 What methods do I have that may allow me to prove this? \n                 What are the assumptions? \n                 How can I use these assumptions to prove the result? \n                Being able to ask these questions is a big step in constructing a proof.\n                The next task is to answer the questions and to use those answers to construct a proof.\n               \n           \n             Emphasis on Active Learning \n               \n                One of the underlying premises of this text is that the best way to learn and understand mathematics is to be actively involved in the learning process.\n                However, it is unlikely that students will learn all the mathematics in a given course on their own.\n                Students actively involved in learning mathematics need appropriate materials that will provide guidance and support in their learning of mathematics.\n                There are several ways this text promotes active learning.\n               \n               \n                With the exception of  ,\n                each section has exactly two beginning activities.\n                These activities should be completed by the students prior to the classroom discussion of the section.\n                The purpose of the beginning activities is to prepare students to participate in the classroom discussion of the section.\n                Some of these activities will review prior mathematical work that is necessary for the new section.\n                This prior work may contain material from previous mathematical courses or it may contain  material covered earlier in this text.\n                Other beginning activities will introduce new concepts and definitions that will be used \n                when that section is discussed in class.\n               \n               \n                Several Progress Checks are included in each section.\n                These are either short exercises or short activities designed to help the students \n                determine if they are understanding the material as it is presented.\n                Some progress checks are also intended to prepare the student for the next topic in \n                the section.\n                Answers to the Progress Checks are provided in  .\n               \n               \n                Explorations and activities are included at the end of the exercises of each section.\n                These activities can be done individually or in a collaborative learning setting,\n                where students work in groups to brainstorm,\n                make conjectures, test each other's ideas,\n                reach consensus, and, it is hoped,\n                develop sound mathematical arguments to support their work.\n                These activities can also be assigned as homework in addition to the other exercises at \n                the end of each section.\n               \n           \n             Other Important Features of the Book \n             \n              Several sections of the text include exercises called Evaluation of Proofs.\n              (The first such exercise appears in  )\n              For these exercises, there is a proposed proof of a proposition.\n              However, the proposition may be true or may be false.\n              If a proposition is false, the proposed proof is, of course, incorrect,\n              and the student is asked to find the error in the proof and then provide a \n              counterexample showing that the proposition is false.\n              However, if the proposition is true,\n              the proof may be incorrect or not well written.\n              In keeping with the emphasis on writing,\n              students are then asked to correct the proof and\/or provide a well-written proof \n              according to the guidelines established in the book.\n             \n             \n              To assist students with studying the material in the text,\n              there is a summary at the end of each chapter.\n              The summaries usually list the important definitions introduced in the chapter and the \n              important results proven in the chapter.\n              If appropriate,\n              the summary also describes the important proof techniques discussed in the chapter.\n             \n             \n              Answers or hints for several exercises are included in an appendix.\n              This was done in response to suggestions from many students at Grand Valley and some \n              students from other institutions who were using the book.\n               \n             \n           \n       Content and Organization \n        Mathematical content is needed as a vehicle for learning how to construct and write proofs.\n        The mathematical content for this text is drawn primarily from elementary number theory,\n        including congruence arithmetic; elementary set theory; functions including injections, \n        surjections,\n        and the inverse of a function;\n        relations and equivalence relations;\n        topics in number theory such as greatest common divisors and prime factorizations;\n        and finite and infinite sets.\n        This material was chosen because it can be used to illustrate a broad range of proof techniques \n        and it is needed as a prerequisite for many upper-level mathematics courses.\n        The chapters in the text can roughly be divided into the following categories:\n       \n          Constructing and Writing Proofs:\n           ,\n           , and\n           \n            Logic: \n             \n            Mathematical Content: \n             ,\n             ,\n             ,\n             , and\n             \n        The first chapter sets the stage for the rest of the book.\n        It introduces students to the use of conditional statements in mathematics,\n        begins instruction in the process of constructing a direct proof of a conditional statement,\n        and introduces many of the writing guidelines that will be used throughout the rest of the book.\n        This is not meant to be a thorough introduction to methods of proof.\n        Before this is done,\n        it is necessary to introduce the students to the parts of logic that are needed to aid in the construction of proofs.\n        This is done in  .\n       \n        Students need to learn some logic and gain experience in the traditional language and proof methods used in mathematics.\n        Since this is a text that deals with constructing and writing mathematical proofs,\n        the logic that is presented in  \n        is intended to aid in the construction of proofs.\n        The goals are to provide students with a thorough understanding of conditional statements,\n        quantifiers, and logical equivalencies.\n        Emphasis is placed on writing correct and useful negations of statements,\n        especially those involving quantifiers.\n        The logical equivalencies that are presented provide the logical basis for some of the standard \n        proof techniques,\n        such as proof by contrapositive,\n        proof by contradiction, and proof using cases.\n       \n        The standard methods for mathematical proofs are discussed in detail in \n         .\n        The mathematical content that is introduced to illustrate these proof methods includes some \n        elementary number theory,\n        including congruence arithmetic.\n        These concepts are used consistently throughout the text as a way to demonstrate ideas in \n        direct proof,\n        proof by contrapositive, proof by contradiction,\n        proof using cases, and proofs using mathematical induction.\n        This gives students a strong introduction to important mathematical ideas while providing the \n        instructor a consistent reference point and an example of how mathematical notation can greatly \n        simplify a concept.\n       \n        The three sections of  \n        are devoted to proofs using mathematical induction.\n        Again, the emphasis is not only on understanding mathematical induction but also on developing \n        the ability to construct and write proofs that use mathematical induction.\n       \n        The last five chapters are considered\n         mathematical content \n        chapters.\n        Concepts of set theory are introduced in  ,\n        and the methods of proof studied in  \n        are used to prove results about sets and operations on sets.\n       \n         \n        provides a thorough study of functions.\n        Functions are studied before relations in order to begin with the more specific notion with which \n        students have some familiarity and move toward the more general notion of a relation.\n        The concept of a function is reviewed but with attention paid to being precise with terminology \n        and is then extended to the general definition of a function.\n        Various proof techniques are employed in the study of injections,\n        surjections, composition of functions,\n        inverses of functions, and functions acting on sets.\n       \n         \n        introduces the concepts of relations and equivalence relations.\n         \n        is included to provide a link between the concept of an equivalence relation and the number \n        theory that has been discussed throughout the text.\n       \n         \n        continues the study of number theory.\n        The highlights include problems dealing with greatest common divisors,\n        prime numbers,\n        the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic,\n        and linear Diophantine equations.\n       \n        Finally,  \n        deals with further topics in set theory,\n        focusing on cardinality, finite sets,\n        countable sets, and uncountable sets.\n       Designing a Course \n        Most instructors who use this text will design a course specifically suited to their needs and \n        the needs of their institution.\n        However, a standard one-semester course in constructing and writing proofs could cover the first \n        six chapters of the text and at least one of  ,\n         ,\n        or  .\n        Please note that  ,\n         ,\n         ,\n         ,\n        and  \n        can be considered optional sections.\n        These are interesting sections that contain important material,\n        but the content of these sections is not essential to study the material in the rest of the book.\n       Supplementary Materials for the Instructor \n        Instructors for a course may obtain pdf files that contain the solutions for the beginning activities and the solutions for the exercises.\n        To obtain these materials,\n        send an email message to the author at  mathreasoning@gmail.com ,\n        and please include the name of your institution (school, college,\n        or university),\n        the course for which you are considering using the text,\n        and a link to a website that can be used to verify your position at your institution.\n       \n        Although not part of the textbook,\n        there are now 107 online videos with about 14 hours of content that span the first seven chapters of this book.\n        These videos are freely available online at Grand Valley's Department of Mathematics YouTube channel on this \n         playlist . These online videos \n        were created and developed by Dr.\n        Robert Talbert of Grand Valley State University.\n       \n        There is also a website for the textbook.\n        For this website,\n        go to   and click on the \n         TEXTBOOKS  button in the upper right corner.\n       \n        Please send any suggestions for the book or the website for the book to the author at \n         mathreasoning@gmail.com .\n       "

This is a false statement since there are values \n            for   and   for which \n             .\n            For example, if   and  ,\n            then   and  \n           \n         \n     Statements \n            Which of the following sentences are statements?\n            Do not worry about determining the truth value of those that are statements;\n            just determine whether

statement.\n             \n              There are integers   and   such that  .\n             \n              This is a statement.\n             \n              Given a line   and a point   not on

   \n              Does the equation   have two real number solutions?\n             \n              This is not a statement.\n             \n              If   is a right triangle with right angle at vertex  ,\n              and if   is the midpoint of the hypotenuse,\n              then the line segment connecting vertex   to   is half the length of \n              the hypotenuse.\n             \n              This is a statement.\n             \n              There do not exist three integers  ,\n               , and   such that  .\n             \n              This is a statement.\n             How Do We Decide If a Statement Is True or False? statement \n      In mathematics,\n      we often establish that a statement is true by writing a mathematical proof.\n      To establish that a statement is false,\n      we often find a so-called counterexample.\n      (These ideas will be explored later in this chapter.)\n      So mathematicians must be able to discover and construct proofs.\n      In addition, once the discovery has been made,\n      the mathematician must be able to communicate this discovery to others who speak the language \n      of mathematics.\n      We will be dealing with these ideas throughout the text.\n     \n      For now, we want to focus on what happens before we start a proof.\n      One thing that mathematicians often do is to make a conjecture beforehand as to whether the \n      statement is true or false.\n      This is often done through exploration.\n      The role of exploration in mathematics is often difficult because the goal is not to find a \n      specific answer but simply to investigate.\n      Following are some techniques of exploration that might be helpful.\n          \n     Techniques of Exploration conjectures conjecture counterexample Explorations \n        Use the techniques of exploration to investigate each of the following statements.\n        Can you make a conjecture as to whether the statement is true or false?\n        Can you determine whether it is true or false?\n         \n           ,\n          for all real numbers   and  .\n         \n            This proposition is false.\n            A counterexample is   and  .\n            For these values,\n              and  .\n           \n          There are integers   and   such that  .\n         \n            This proposition is true,\n            as we can see by using   and  .\n            We could also use   and  .\n            There are many other possible choices for   and  .\n           \n          If   is an even integer,\n          then   is an even integer.\n         \n            This proposition appears to be true.\n            Anytime we use an example where   is an even integer,\n            the number   is an even integer.\n            However, we cannot claim that this is true based on examples since we cannot list \n            all of the examples where   is an even integer.\n           \n          If   and   are odd integers,\n          then   is an odd integer.\n         \n            This proposition appears to be true.\n            Anytime we use an example where   and   are both odd integers,\n            the number   is an odd integer.\n            However, we cannot claim that this is true based on examples since we cannot list \n            all of the examples where both   and   are odd integers.\n           Conditional Statements \n      We had our first encounter with conditional statements in  \n      Beginning Activity 2 .\n      Since conditional statements are the most important type of statement in mathematics,\n      we give a more formal definition.\n     Definition conditional statement statement conditional conditional statement hypothesis conditional statement conclusion conditional statement hypothesis conclusion \n      Intuitively,\n       If   then  \n      means that   must be true whenever   is true.\n      Because conditional statements are used so often,\n      a symbolic shorthand notation is used to represent the conditional statement\n       If   then  . \n      We will use the notation   to represent\n       If   then  . \n      When   and   are statements,\n      it seems reasonable that the truth value\n      (true or false)\n      of the conditional statement   depends on the truth values of   and  .\n      There are four cases to consider:\n       \n           \n              is true and   is true.\n           \n         \n           \n              is true and   is false.\n           \n         \n           \n              is false and   is true.\n           \n         \n           \n              is false and   is false.\n           \n         \n     truth table Truth Table for  \n         \n       \n         \n       \n         \n       \n        T\n       \n        T\n       \n        T\n       \n        T\n       \n        F\n       \n        F\n       \n        F\n       \n        T\n       \n        T\n       \n        F\n       \n        F\n       \n        T\n       \n      The important thing to remember is that the conditional statement   has its \n      own truth value.\n      It is either true or false\n      (and not both).\n      Its truth value depends on the truth values for   and  ,\n      but some find it a bit puzzling that the conditional statement is considered to be true when \n      the hypothesis   is false.\n      We will provide a justification for this through the use of an example.\n     \n          Suppose that I say\n           If it is not raining, then Daisy is riding her bike. \n          We can represent this conditional statement as   where   is the statement,\n           It is not raining \n          and   is the statement,\n           Daisy is riding her bike. \n         \n          Although it is not a perfect analogy,\n          think of the statement   as being  false \n          to mean that I lied and think of the statement   as being  true \n          to mean that I did not lie.\n          We will now check the truth value of   based on the truth values of   \n          and  .\n           \n               \n                Suppose that both   and   are true.\n                That is, it is not raining and Daisy is riding her bike.\n                In this case,\n                it seems reasonable to say that I told the truth and that   is true.\n               \n             \n               \n                Suppose that   is true and   is false or that it is not raining and \n                Daisy is not riding her bike.\n                It would appear that by making the statement,\n                 If it is not raining, then Daisy is riding her bike, \n                I have not told the truth.\n                So in this case, the statement   is false.\n               \n             \n               \n                Now suppose that   is false and   is true or that it is raining and \n                Daisy is riding her bike.\n                Did I make a false statement by stating that if it is not raining,\n                then Daisy is riding her bike?\n                The key is that I did not make any statement about what would happen if it was raining,\n                and so I did not tell a lie.\n                So we consider the conditional statement,\n                 If it is not raining, then Daisy is riding her bike, \n                to be true in the case where it is raining and Daisy is riding her bike.\n               \n             \n               \n                Finally, suppose that both   and   are false.\n                That is, it is raining and Daisy is not riding her bike.\n                As in the previous situation,\n                since my statement was  , I made no claim about what would happen \n                if it was raining,\n                and so I did not tell a lie.\n                So the statement   cannot be false in this case and so we consider \n                it to be true.\n               \n             \n         Explorations with Conditional Statements \n            Consider the following sentence:  If   is a positive real number,\n            then   is a positive real number. \n            Although the hypothesis and conclusion of this conditional sentence are not statements,\n            the conditional sentence itself can be considered to be a statement as long as we know \n            what possible numbers may be used for the variable  .\n            From the context of this sentence,\n            it seems that we can substitute any positive real number for  .\n            We can also substitute 0 for   or a negative real number for   provided \n            that we are willing to work with a false hypothesis in the conditional statement.\n            (In  ,\n            we will learn how to be more careful and precise with these types of conditional statements.)\n           \n            Notice that if  ,\n            then  , which is negative.\n            Does this mean that the given conditional statement is false?\n           \n              This does not mean the conditional statement is false since when  ,\n              the hypothesis is false,\n              and the only time a conditional statement is false is when the hypothesis is \n              true and the conclusion is false.\n             \n            Notice that if  , then  ,\n            which is positive.\n            Does this mean that the given conditional statement is true?\n           \n              This does not mean the conditional statment is true since we have not checked all \n              positive real numbers,\n              only the one where  .\n             \n            Do you think this conditional statement is true or false?\n            Record the results for at least five different examples where the hypothesis of this conditional statement is true.\n           \n            All examples should indicate that the conditional statement is true.\n           \n             If   is a positive integer,\n            then   is a prime number. \n            (Remember that a prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 whose only \n            positive factors are 1 and itself.) To explore whether or not this statement is true,\n            try using\n            (and recording your results)\n            for  ,  ,\n             ,  ,  , and  .\n            Then record the results for at least four other values of  .\n            Does this conditional statement appear to be true?\n           \n            The number   will be a prime number for all examples \n            of   that are less than 41.\n            However, when  , we get\n             \n            So in the case where   ,\n            the hypothesis is true  (41 is a positive integer) and the conclusion is false \n             .\n            Therefore, 41 is a counterexample that shows the conditional statement is false.\n            There are other counterexamples\n            (such as  ,  , and   ),\n            but only one counterexample is needed to prove that the statement is false.\n           Further Remarks about Conditional Statements conditional statement statement conditional \n         \n          The conventions for the truth value of conditional statements may seem a bit strange,\n          especially the fact that the conditional statement is true when the hypothesis of the \n          conditional statement is false.\n          The following example is meant to show that this makes sense.\n         \n         \n          Suppose that Ed has exactly $52 in his wallet.\n          The following four statements will use the four possible truth combinations for the \n          hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement.\n           \n               \n                If Ed has exactly $52 in his wallet,\n                then he has at least $20 in his wallet.\n                This is a true statement.\n                Notice that both the hypothesis and the conclusion are true.\n               \n             \n               \n                If Ed has exactly $52 in his wallet,\n                then he has $100 in his wallet.\n                This statement is false.\n                Notice that the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.\n               \n             \n               \n                If Ed has $100 in his wallet,\n                then he has at least $50 in his wallet.\n                This statement is true regardless of how much money he has in his wallet.\n                In this case,\n                the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true.\n               \n             \n               \n                If Ed has $100 in his wallet,\n                then he has at least $80 in his wallet.\n                This statement is true regardless of how much money he has in his wallet.\n                In this case,\n                the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is false.\n               \n             \n         \n         \n           \n            This is admittedly a contrived example but it does illustrate that the conventions \n            for the \n            truth value of a conditional statement make sense.\n            The message is that in order to be complete in mathematics,\n            we need to have conventions about when a conditional statement is true and when it \n            is false.\n           \n         \n       \n         \n          The fact that there is only one case when a conditional statement is false often provides a \n          method to show that a given conditional statement is false.\n          In  ,\n          you were asked if you thought the following conditional statement was true or false.\n           If     is a positive integer,\n          then    is a prime number. \n          For many values of  ,\n            turns out to be a prime number.\n          However, if we try   , we get\n           .\n          So in the case where   ,\n          the hypothesis is true  (41 is a positive integer) and the conclusion is false \n          (  is not prime).\n          Therefore, 41 is a counterexample for this conjecture and the conditional statement is false.\n          There are other counterexamples\n          (such as  ,  , and   ),\n          but only one counterexample is needed to prove that the statement is false.\n         \n       \n         \n          Although one example can be used to prove that a conditional statement is false,\n          in most cases,\n          we cannot use examples to prove that a conditional statement is true.\n          For example,\n          in  ,\n          we substituted values for   for the conditional statement\n           If   is a positive real number,\n          then   is a positive real number. \n          For every positive real number used for  ,\n          we saw that   was positive.\n          However, this does not prove the conditional statement to be true because it is impossible to substitute every positive real number for  .\n          So, although we may believe this statement is true,\n          to be able to conclude it is true,\n          we need to write a mathematical proof.\n          Methods of proof will be discussed in  \n          and  .\n         \n       Working with a Conditional Statement \n        Sometimes, we must be aware of conventions that are being used.\n        In most calculus texts,\n        the convention is that any function has a domain and a range that are subsets of the real \n        numbers.\n        In addition, when we say something like\n         the function   is differentiable at  , it is understood \n        that   is a real number.\n        With these conventions, the following statement is a true statement,\n        which is proven in many calculus texts.\n         If the function   is differentiable at  ,\n        then the function   is continuous at  . \n        Using only this true statement,\n        is it possible to make a conclusion about the function in each of the following cases?\n       \n          It is known that the function  ,\n          where  , is differentiable at 0.\n         \n            We can conclude that this function is continuous at 0.\n           \n          It is known that the function  ,\n          where  ,\n          is not differentiable at 0.\n         \n            We can make no conclusion about this function from the theorem.\n           \n          It is known that the function  ,\n          where  , is continuous at 0.\n         \n            We can make no conclusion about this function from the theorem.\n           \n          It is known that the function  ,\n          where  , is not continuous at 0.\n         \n            We can conclude that this function is not differentiable at 0.\n           Closure Properties of Number Systems set of real numbers set of rational numbers set of integers real number system rational numbers irrational numbers natural numbers integers closed under addition closed under multiplication closed under subtraction \n      Notice that these so-called closure properties are defined in terms of conditional statements.\n      This means that if we can find one instance where the hypothesis is true and the conclusion \n      is false,\n      then the conditional statement is false.\n     Closure \n              In order for the set of natural numbers to be closed under subtraction,\n              the following conditional statement would have to be true: If   and   are natural numbers,\n              then   is a natural number.\n              However, since 5 and 8 are natural numbers,  ,\n              which is not a natural number,\n              this conditional statement is false.\n              Therefore, the set of natural numbers is not closed under subtraction.\n             \n              We can use the rules for multiplying fractions and the closure rules for the integers to show that the rational numbers are closed under multiplication.\n              If   and   are rational numbers\n              (so  ,  ,  ,\n              and   are integers and   and   are not zero),\n              then\n               .\n              Since the integers are closed under multiplication,\n              we know that   and   are integers and since   and  ,\n               .\n              So   is a rational number and this shows that the rational numbers are closed under multiplication.\n

possible to formulate a conjecture about the units digit of numbers of the form \n         ,\n        where   is a natural number?\n        If so, formulate a conjecture in the form of a conditional statement in the form\n         If   is a natural number, then   . \n       \n        Let  .\n        Determine the first eight derivatives of this function.\n        What do you observe?\n

    from what we know? \n      One way to answer this is to use our prior knowledge of algebra.\n      That is, we can first use substitution to write \n       .\n      Although this equation does not prove that   is odd,\n      we can use algebra to try to rewrite the right side of this equation\n        in the form of an odd integer so \n      that we can arrive at step  .\n      We first expand the right side of the equation to obtain\n       \n     \n      Now compare the right side of the last equation to the right side of the equation in \n      step  .\n      Sometimes the difficult part at this point is the realization that   stands for some \n      integer and that we only have to show that\n        equals two times some integer plus one.\n      Can we now make that conclusion?\n      The answer is yes because we can factor a 2 from the first three terms on the right side of \n      the equation and obtain\n       \n     \n      We can now complete the table showing the outline

have only constructed an outline of a proof.\n      Mathematical proofs are not written in table form.\n      They are written in narrative form using complete sentences and correct paragraph structure,\n      and they follow certain conventions used in writing mathematics.\n      In addition,\n      most proofs are written only from the forward perspective.\n      That is, although the use of the backward process was essential in discovering the proof,\n      when we write the proof in narrative form,\n      we use the forward process described in the preceding table.\n          \n      A completed proof follows.\n     \n          If   and   are odd integers,\n          then   is an odd integer.\n         \n        We assume that   and   are odd integers and will prove that \n          is an odd integer.\n        Since   and   are odd,\n        there exist integers   and   such that\n         .\n       \n        Using algebra, we obtain\n         .\n       \n        Since   and   are integers and the integers are closed under \n        addition and multiplication,\n        we conclude that   is an integer.\n        This means that   has been written in the form\n          for some integer  ,\n        and hence,\n          is an odd integer.\n        Consequently,\n        it has been proven that if   and   are odd integers,\n        then   is an odd integer. \n       Writing Guidelines for Mathematics Proofs writing guidelines \n          \n      At the risk of oversimplification,\n      doing mathematics can be considered to have two distinct stages.\n      The first stage is to convince yourself that you have solved the problem or proved a conjecture.\n      This stage is a creative one and is quite often how mathematics is actually done.\n      The second equally important stage is to convince other people that you have solved the \n      problem or proved the conjecture.\n      This second stage often has little in common with the first stage in the

proof for \n         ,\n        we had only one answer for the backward question and one answer for the forward question.\n        Often, there can be more than one answer for these questions.\n        For example,\n        consider the following statement: \n         If   is an odd integer,\n        then   is an odd integer. \n        The backward question for this could be,\n         How do I prove that an integer is an odd integer? \n        One way to answer this is to use the definition of an odd integer,\n        but another way is to use the result of  .\n        That is, we can prove an integer is odd by proving that it is a product of two odd integers.\n       \n       \n        The difficulty then is deciding which answer to use.\n        Sometimes we can tell by carefully watching the interplay between the forward \n        process and the backward process. Other times,\n        we may have to work with more than one possible answer.\n       \n     \n       \n        Sometimes we can use previously proven results to answer a forward question or \n        a backward question.\n        This was the case in the example given in  ,\n        where  \n        was used to answer a backward question.\n       \n     \n       \n        Although we start with two separate processes\n        (forward and backward),\n        the key to constructing a proof is to find a way to link these two processes.\n        This can be difficult.\n        One way to proceed is to use the know portion of the table to motivate answers to \n        backward questions and to use the show portion of the table to motivate answers to \n        forward questions.\n       \n     \n       \n        Answering a backward question can sometimes be tricky.\n        If the goal is the statement   ,\n        we must construct the know-show table so that if we know that    is true,\n        then we can conclude that   is true.\n        It is sometimes easy to answer this in a way that if it is known that    is true,\n        then we can conclude that   is true.\n        For example, suppose the goal is to prove\n           ,\n        where     is a real number.\n        A backward question could be,\n         How do we prove the square of a real number equals four? \n        One possible answer is to prove that the real number equals 2.\n        Another way is to prove that the real number equals  .\n        This is an appropriate backward question,\n        and these are appropriate answers.\n       \n       \n        However, if the goal is to prove\n           ,\n        where     is a real number, we could ask,\n         How do we prove a real number equals 2? \n        It is not appropriate to answer this question with\n         prove that the square of the real number equals 4. \n        This is because if  ,\n        then it is not necessarily true that  .\n       \n     \n       \n        Finally, it is very important to realize that not every proof can be constructed by \n        the use of a simple know-show table.\n        Proofs will get more complicated than the ones that are in this section.\n        The main point of this section is not the know-show table itself,\n        but the way of thinking about a proof that is indicated by a know-show table.\n        In most proofs,\n        it is very important to specify carefully what it is that is being assumed and what \n        it is that we are trying to prove.\n        The process of asking the\n         backward questions \n        and the\n         forward questions \n        is the important part of the know-show table.\n        It is very important to get into the\n         habit of mind \n        of working backward from what it is we are trying to prove and working forward from \n        what it is we are assuming.\n        Instead of immediately trying to write a complete proof,\n        we need to stop, think, and ask questions such as\n         \n          Just exactly what is it that I am trying to prove?\n         \n         \n          How can I prove this?\n         \n         \n          What methods do I have that may allow me to prove this?\n         \n         \n          What are the assumptions?\n         \n         \n          How can I use these assumptions to prove the result?\n         \n       \n     Exploring a Proposition \n        Construct a table of values for\n          using at least six different integers for  .\n        Make one-half of the values for   even integers and the other half odd integers.\n        Is the following proposition true or false?\n         If   is an odd integer,\n        then   is an odd integer. \n       \n        Justify your conclusion.\n        This means that if the proposition is true,\n        then you should write a proof of the proposition.\n        If the proposition is false,\n        you need to provide an example of an odd integer for which \n          is an even integer.\n       \n          All examples should indicate the proposition is true.\n          Following is a proof.\n         \n            We assume that   is an odd integer and will prove that \n              is an odd integer.\n            Since   is an odd integer,\n            there exists an integer   such that  .\n            Substituting this into the expression\n              and using algebra,\n            we obtain\n             \n           \n            By the closure properties of the integers,\n              is an integer, and hence,\n            the last equation shows that   is an odd integer.\n            This proves that if   is an odd integer,\n            then   is an odd integer. \n           Constructing and Writing a Proof Pythagorean Theorem Pythagorean Theorem \n        Construct and provide a well-written proof for the following proposition.\n  \n           \n           Proposition: If   is a real number and  ,  ,\n           and   are the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle,\n           then  .\n           \n\n       \n        Although this proposition uses different mathematical concepts than the one used in \n        this section,\n        the process of constructing a proof for this proposition is the same forward-backward method \n        that was used to construct a proof for  .\n        However, the backward question,\n         How do we prove that  ?

false\n                (it is not raining)\n                and   is true (Daisy is playing golf).\n               \n                When   is false\n                (it is not raining)\n                and   is false (Daisy is not playing golf).\n               \n      In the beginning activities for this section,\n      we learned about compound statements and their truth values.\n      This information can be summarized with the following truth tables:\n     \n     \n               \n             \n               \n             \n              T\n             \n              F\n             \n              F\n             \n              T\n             T T T T F F F T F F F F \n\n     T T T T F T F T T F F F T T T T F F F T T F F T \n     \n      Rather than memorizing the truth tables,\n      for many people it is easier to remember the rules summarized in  .\n     Truth Values for Common Connectives Operator Symbolic Form Summary of Truth Values Conjunction True only when both   and   are true Disjunction False only when both   and   are false Negation Opposite truth value of  Conditional False only when   is true and   is false Other Forms of Conditional Statements conditional statement conditional statement forms of statement conditional Conditional statements necessary sufficient hypothesis conclusion The  Only If  Statement \n        Recall that a quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon.\n        Let   represent the following true conditional statement: \n         \n        If a quadrilateral is a square,\n        then it is a rectangle.\n         \n       \n        Write this conditional statement in English using\n       \n          the word  whenever \n         \n            Whenever a quadrilateral is a square, it is a rectangle,\n            or a quadrilateral is a rectangle whenever it is a square.\n           \n          the phrase  only if \n         \n            A quadrilateral is a square only if it is a rectangle.\n           \n          the phrase  is necessary for \n         \n            Being a rectangle is necessary for a quadrilateral to be a square.\n           \n          the phrase  is sufficient for \n         \n            Being a square is sufficient for a quadrilateral to be a rectangle.\n           Constructing Truth Tables \n      Truth tables for compound statements can be constructed by using the truth tables for the \n      basic connectives.\n      To illustrate this,\n      we will construct a truth table for  .\n      The first step is to determine the number of rows needed.\n     \n           \n            For a truth table with two different simple statements,\n            four rows are needed since there are four different combinations of truth values for the \n            two statements.\n            We should be consistent with how we set up the rows.\n            The way we will do it in this text is to label the rows for the first statement with \n            (T, T, F, F) and the rows for the second statement with (T, F, T, F).\n            All truth tables in the text have this scheme.\n           \n         \n           \n            For a truth table with three different simple statements,\n            eight rows are needed since there are eight different combinations of truth values for \n            the three statements.\n            Our standard scheme for this type of truth table is shown in \n             .\n           \n         \n      The next step is to determine the columns to be used.\n      One way to do this is to work backward from the form of the given statement.\n      For  ,\n      the last step is to deal with the conditional operator  .\n      To do this, we need to know the truth values of   and \n       .\n      To determine the truth values for  ,\n      we need to apply the rules for the conjunction operator\n        and we need to know the truth values for \n        and  .\n     \n       \n      is a completed truth table for\n        with the step numbers indicated at the \n      bottom of each column.\n      The step numbers correspond to the order in which the columns were completed.\n     Truth Table for  T T T F F T T T F F F T T F T T T T T F F T T F F T T F F T F T F F F T F F T T F T F F F T F T 1 1 1 2 3 4 \n     \n       \n        When completing the column for  ,\n            remember that the only time the conjunction is true is when both   and \n              are true.\n       \n     \n       \n        When completing the column for  ,\n        remember that the only time the conditional statement is false is when the hypothesis\n          is true and the conclusion,\n         ,\n        is false.\n       \n     \n     \n      The last column entered is the truth table for the statement\n        using the setup in the first three columns.\n     Constructing Truth Tables \n          Construct a truth table for each of the following statements:\n         \n           \n         \n           \n         \n           \n         \n           \n         \n             T T F F F F T F T T F T F T F T F T F F F T T T \n           \n            Statements (2) and (4) have the same truth table.\n           \n          Do any of these statements have the same truth table?\n         The Biconditional Statement biconditional statement statement biconditional biconditional statement biconditional statement The Truth Table for the Biconditional Statement \n        Complete a truth table for \n         .\n        Use the following columns:\n         ,  ,  ,  ,\n        and  .\n        The last column of this table will be the truth table for  .\n       Other Forms of the Biconditional Statement biconditional statement forms of \n          \n      As with the conditional statement,\n      there are some common ways to express the biconditional statement,\n       , in the English language.\n      For example,\n            if and only if  .\n           \n            implies   and   implies  .\n           \n            is necessary and sufficient for  .\n           \n     Tautologies and Contradictions Definition tautology contradiction tautology contradiction \n      That is, a tautology is necessarily true in all circumstances,\n      and a contradiction is necessarily false in all circumstances.\n     Tautologies and Contradictions \n        For statements   and  :\n       \n            Use a truth table to show that   is a tautology.\n           \n          Use a truth table to show that   \n          is a contradiction.\n         \n          Use a truth table to determine if   is a tautology,\n          a contradiction, or neither.\n         \n           T F T F F T T F \n         \n           T T T T T F T T F T T T F F F T \n           .\n

Daisy's statement true or false?\n          Support your conclusion.\n         \n          The statement was true.

to develop and state several different logical equivalencies at this time.\n      However, we will restrict ourselves to what are considered to be some of the most important ones.\n      Since many mathematical statements are written in the form of conditional statements,\n      logical equivalencies related to conditional statements are quite important.\n     Logical Equivalencies Related to Conditional Statements conditional statement logical equivalencies \n      The first two logical equivalencies in   were \n      established in  Beginning Activity 1 , and the third \n      logical equivalency was \n      established in  Beginning Activity 2 .\n     \n          For statements   and  ,\n           \n             \n                The conditional statement   is logically equivalent to \n                 .\n             \n           \n             \n                The statement   is logically equivalent to \n                 .\n             \n           \n             \n                The conditional statement   is logically equivalent to its \n                contrapositive  .\n             \n           \n         The Negation of a Conditional Statement negation of a conditional statement conditional statement negation \n          \n      The logical equivalency   \n      is interesting because it shows us that\n       the negation of a conditional statement is not another conditional statement. \n      \n      The negation of a conditional statement can be written in the form of a conjunction.\n      So what does it mean to say that the conditional statement \n       \n        If you do not clean your room,\n        then you cannot watch TV, \n       \n      is false?\n      To answer this,\n      we can use the logical equivalency  .\n      The idea is that if   is false,\n      then its negation must be true.\n      So the negation of this can be written as \n       \n        You do not clean your room and you can watch TV. \n       \n      For another example,\n      consider the following conditional statement: \n       \n\n      This conditional statement is false since its hypothesis is true and its conclusion is false.\n      Consequently, its negation must be true.\n      Its negation is not a conditional statement.\n      The negation can be written in the form of a conjunction by using the logical equivalency \n       .\n      So, the negation can be written as follows:\n       .\n      However, the second part of this conjunction can be written in a simpler manner by noting that\n       not less than \n      means the same thing as\n       greater than or equal to. \n      So we use this to write the negation of the original conditional statement as follows:\n       .\n      This conjunction is true since each of the individual statements in the conjunction is true.\n     Another Method of Establishing Logical Equivalencies \n      We have seen that it is often possible to use a truth table to establish a logical equivalency.\n      However, it is also possible to prove a logical equivalency using a sequence of previously established logical equivalencies.\n      For example,\n       \n           \n              is logically equivalent to  .\n            So\n           \n         \n           \n              is logically equivalent to \n             .\n           \n         \n           \n            Hence, by   (one of DeMorgan's Laws),\n              is logically equivalent to \n             .\n           \n         \n           \n            This means that   is logically equivalent to \n             .\n           \n         \n     \n      The last step used the fact that\n        is logically equivalent to  .\n     \n      When proving theorems in mathematics,\n      it is often important to be able to decide if two expressions are logically equivalent.\n      Sometimes when we are attempting to prove a theorem,\n      we may be unsuccessful in developing a proof for the original statement of the theorem.\n      However, in some cases, it is possible to prove an equivalent statement.\n      Knowing that the statements are equivalent tells us that if we prove one,\n      then we have also proven the other.\n      In fact, once we know the truth value of a statement,\n      then we know the truth value of any other logically equivalent statement.\n      This is illustrated in  .\n     \n          In  ,\n          we constructed a truth table for  .\n          See  .\n         \n          Although it is possible to use truth tables to show that\n            is logically equivalent to \n           ,\n          we instead use previously proven logical equivalencies to prove this logical equivalency.\n          In this case,\n          it may be easier to start working with  .\n          Start with\n           ,\n          which is justified by the logical equivalency established in \n            of\n           Beginning Activity 1 .\n          Continue by using one of De Morgan's Laws on \n           .\n         \n          Starting with the suggested equivalency, we obtain\n           \n         \n          Let   and   be integers.\n          Suppose we are trying to prove the following:\n           \n            If 3 is a factor of  ,\n            then 3 is a factor of   or 3 is a factor of  .\n           \n          Explain why we will have proven this statement if we prove the following:\n           \n            If 3 is a factor of   and 3 is not a factor of  ,\n            then 3 is a factor of  .\n           \n         \n          For this, let   be,\n           3 is a factor of  , \n          let   be,\n           3 is a factor of  , \n          and let   be,\n           3 is a factor of  . \n          Then the stated proposition is written in the form  .\n          Since this is logically equivalent to  ,\n          if we prove that if 3 is a factor of\n            and 3 is not a factor of  ,\n          then 3 is a factor of  ,\n          then we have proven the original proposition.\n         \n      As we will see,\n      it is often difficult to construct a direct proof for a conditional statement of the form \n       .\n      The logical equivalency in  \n      gives us another way to attempt to prove a statement of the form\n       .\n      The advantage of the equivalent form,\n       ,\n      is that we have an additional assumption,\n       , in the hypothesis.\n      This gives us more information with which to work.\n     \n       \n      states some of the most frequently used logical equivalencies used when writing mathematical proofs.\n     Important Logical Equivalencies distributive laws for statements \n          For statements  ,  , and  ,\n         De Morgan's Laws Conditional Statements

playing golf, then it is not raining. \n                Contrapositive: If Laura is not playing golf, then it is raining.\n               \n              If  , then  .\n             \n

  "body": "Open Sentences and Sets Beginning Activity 1: Sets and Set Notation \n        The theory of sets is fundamental to mathematics in the sense that many areas of mathematics \n        use set theory and its language and notation.\n        This language and notation must be understood if we are to communicate effectively in \n        mathematics.\n        At this point,\n        we will give a very brief introduction to some of the terminology used in set theory.\n       set \n        The most basic way of specifying the elements of a set is to list the elements of that set.\n        This works well when the set contains only a small number of objects.\n        The usual practice is to list these elements between braces.\n        For example,\n        if the set   consists of the integer solutions of the equation  ,\n        we would write\n         .\n       \n        For larger sets,\n        it is sometimes inconvenient to list all of the elements of the set.\n        In this case,\n        we often list several of them and then write a series of three dots  \n        ( ) to indicate that the pattern continues.\n        For example,\n         \n        is the set of all odd natural numbers from 1 to 49, inclusive.\n       \n        For some sets,\n        it is not possible to list all of the elements of a set;\n        we then list several of the elements in the set and again use a series of three dots  \n        ( ) to indicate that the pattern continues.\n        For example,\n        if   is the set of all even natural numbers, we could write\n         .\n       \n        We can also use the three dots before listing specific elements to indicate the pattern \n        prior to those elements.\n        For example,\n        if   is the set of all even integers, we could write\n         .\n       roster method \n            Use the roster method to specify the elements of each of the following sets:\n           \n                The set of real numbers that are solutions of the equation  .\n               \n                The set of natural numbers that are less than or equal to 10.\n               \n                The set of integers that are greater than  .\n               \n            Each of the following sets is defined using the roster method.\n            For each set,\n            determine four elements of the set other than the ones listed using the roster method.\n           \n                 \n               \n                 \n               \n                 \n               \n                  \n

example,\n        if   is the set of all integers greater than 4, then we could write   \n        and  .\n       \n     \n      is not an element of  \n       \n        If an object   is not an element in the set  ,\n        we write   and read this as\n          is not an element of  . \n        For example,\n        if   is the set of all integers greater than 4, then we could write\n          and  .\n       \n     \n\n      When working with a mathematical object, such as set,\n      we need to define when two of these objects are equal.\n      We are also often interested in whether or not one set is contained in another set.\n     Definition equal sets set equality set equality equal subset contained \n      Using these definitions, we see that for any set  ,\n        and since it is true that for each  ,\n      if  ,\n      then  , we also see that  .\n      That is, any set is equal to itself and any set is a subset of itself.\n      For some specific examples, we see that:\n         \n             \n               \n             \n           \n             \n               \n             \n           \n             \n               \n             \n           \n             \n               \n             \n           \n\n      In each of the first three examples,\n      the two sets have exactly the same elements even though the elements may be repeated or \n      written in a different order.\n     Set Notation \n          Let  .\n          Use correct set notation to indicate which of the following integers are in the set \n            and which are not in the set  .\n          For example,\n          we could write   and  .\n           \n         \n           ,  ,  ,\n           ,  ,  \n         \n            Use correct set notation\n            (using   or  )\n            to indicate which of the following sets are equal and which are subsets of one of \n            the other sets.\n             \n           \n             ,  ,\n             ,  ,\n             ,  ,  \n           Variables and Open Sentences open sentence predicate propositional function Notation \n      One reason an open sentence is sometimes called a propositional \n      function is the fact that we use function notation\n        for an open sentence in   variables.\n      When there is only one variable,\n      such as  , we write  , which is read\n        of  . \n      In this notation,\n        represents an arbitrary element of the universal set,\n      and   represents a sentence.\n      When we substitute a specific element of the universal set for  ,\n      the resulting sentence becomes a statement.\n      This is illustrated in the next example.\n     Open Sentences \n          If the universal set is  , then the sentence\n           \n          is an open sentence involving the one variable  .\n        \n         \n                If we substitute  ,\n                we obtain the false statement . \n         \n                If we substitute  ,\n                we obtain the true statement . \n\n          In this example, we can let   be the predicate\n           \n          and then say that   is false and   is true.\n         \n          Using similar notation, we can let   be the predicate\n           . \n          This predicate involves two variables.\n          Then,\n            is false since\n                 \n                is false; and\n           \n            is true since\n                 \n                is true.\n           \n         \n            Assume the universal set for all variables is   and let   be the \n            predicate \n             . \n           \n              Find two values of   for which   is false.\n             \n                Two values of   for which   is false are   and \n                 .\n               \n              Find two values of   for which   is true.\n             \n                The set of all   for which   is true is the set \n                 .\n               \n              Use the roster method to specify the set of all   for which   is true.\n             \n            Assume the universal set for all variables is  ,\n            and let   be the predicate\n             . \n           \n              Find two different examples for which   is false.\n             \n                Two examples for which   is false are:\n                 ,  ,\n                  and  ,\n                 ,  .\n               \n              Find two different examples for which   is true.\n             \n                Two examples for which   is true are:\n                 ,  ,\n                  and  ,\n                 ,  .\n               truth set of a predicate truth set of an open sentence with one variable Set Builder Notation set builder notation set builder notation \n      For a non-mathematical example,\n        could be the property that a college student is a mathematics major.\n      Then   denotes the set of all college students who are \n      mathematics majors.\n      This could be written as\n       .\n     Truth Sets \n          Assume the universal set is   and   is\n           . \n          We can describe the truth set of   as the set of all real numbers whose square \n          is less than 4.\n          We can also use set builder notation to write the truth set of   as\n           .\n         \n          However, if we solve the inequality  ,\n          we obtain  .\n          So we could also write the truth set as\n           .\n         \n          We could read this as the set of all real numbers that are greater than   and less \n          than 2.\n          We can also write\n           .\n         Working with Truth Sets \n        Let   be the predicate\n         . \n       \n              If the universal set is  ,\n              describe the truth set of   using English and write the truth set of \n                using set builder notation.\n             \n              The truth set is the set of all real numbers whose square is less than or equal to 9.\n              The truth set is  .\n             \n              If the universal set is  ,\n              then what is the truth set of  ?\n              Describe this set using English and then use the roster method to specify all the \n              elements of this truth set.\n             \n                The truth set is the set of all integers whose square is less than or equal to 9.\n                The truth set is  .\n               \n              Are the truth sets in   and   equal?\n              Explain.\n             \n                The truth sets in Parts (1) and (2) equal are not equal.\n                One purpose of this progress check is to show that the truth set of a predicate \n                depends on the predicate and on the universal set.\n               \n      So far, our standard form for set builder notation has been \n       .\n      It is sometimes possible to modify this form and put the predicate first.\n      For example, the set\n       \n      describes the set of all natural numbers of the form   for some natural number.\n      By substituting 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on,\n      for  , we can use the roster method to write\n       .\n     \n      We can sometimes\n       reverse this process \n      by starting with a set specified by the roster method and then writing the same set using set \n      builder notation.\n     Set Builder Notation \n          Let  .\n          The key to writing this set using set builder notation is to recognize the pattern involved.\n          We see that once we have an integer in  ,\n          we can obtain another integer in   by adding 4.\n          This suggests that the predicate we will use will involve multiplying by 4.\n         \n          Since it is usually easier to work with positive numbers,\n          we notice that   and  .\n          Notice that\n           .\n         \n          This suggests that we might try  .\n          In fact, by trying other integers for  , we can see that\n           .\n         Set Builder Notation \n        Each of the following sets is defined using the roster method.\n         \n       \n              Determine four elements of each set other than the ones listed using the roster method.\n             \n            Use set builder notation to describe each set.\n           \n               .\n             The Empty Set empty set the empty set empty set \n      In mathematics,\n      the empty set is usually designated by the symbol  .\n      We usually read the symbol   as\n       the empty set \n      or\n       the null set. \n      (The symbol   is actually the next to last letter in the Danish-Norwegian \n      alphabet.)\n     When the Truth Set Is the Universal Set \n      The truth set of a predicate can be the universal set.\n      For example,\n      if the universal set is the set of real numbers  ,\n      then the truth set of the predicate \n       \n      is  .\n     \n      Notice that the sentence\n       \n      has not been quantified and a particular element of the universal set has not been substituted \n      for the variable  .\n      Even though the truth set for this sentence is the universal set,\n      we will adopt the convention that unless the quantifier is stated explicitly,\n      we will consider the sentence to be a predicate or open sentence.\n      So, with this convention, if the universal set is  , then\n       \n         \n              is a predicate;\n           \n           \n           \n            For each real number  ,\n              is a statement.\n           \n           \n     \n          Use the roster method to specify the elements in each of the following sets and then write \n          a sentence in English describing the set.\n         \n               \n             \n                The set of all real number solutions of the equation  ,\n                which is  .\n

An existential   quantifier: \n             \n               There exists an   such that  , \n              where     is a predicate. There is at least one value   of   in the universal set that \n             makes\n              true. \n        In effect, the table indicates that the universally quantified statement is true provided \n        that the truth set of the predicate equals the universal set,\n        and the existentially quantified statement is true provided that the truth set of the \n        predicate contains at least one element.\n       \n        Each of the following sentences is a \n            statement or an open sentence.\n            Assume that the universal set for each variable in these sentences is the set of all real \n            numbers.\n            If a sentence is an open sentence (predicate), determine its truth set.\n            If a sentence is a statement,\n            determine whether it is true or false.\n       \n               .\n             \n               .\n             \n               .\n             \n               .\n             \n               .\n

Quantified Statements \n              Consider the following statement written in symbolic form:\n               .\n             \n                  Write this statement as an English sentence.\n                 \n                  Is the statement true or false?\n                  Why?\n                 \n                  How would you write the negation of this statement as an English sentence?\n                 \n                  If possible,\n                  write your negation of this statement from   \n                  symbolically\n                  (using a quantifier).\n                 \n              Consider the following statement written in symbolic form:\n               .\n             \n                  Write this statement as an English sentence.\n                 \n                  Is the statement true or false?\n                  Why?\n                 \n                  How would you write the negation of this statement as an English sentence?\n                 \n                  If possible,\n              write your negation of this statement from   symbolically\n              (using a quantifier).\n                 \n      We introduced the concepts of open sentences and quantifiers in  .\n      Review the definitions given in  Definition ,\n       Definition ,\n      and  Definition .\n       \n     Forms of Quantified Statements in English \n      There are many ways to write statements involving quantifiers in English.\n      In some cases, the quantifiers are not apparent,\n      and this often happens with conditional statements.\n      The following examples illustrate these points.\n      Each example contains a quantified statement written in symbolic form followed by several \n      ways to write the statement in English.\n     \n                 \n                 \n                  For each real number  ,  .\n                 \n                 \n                 \n                  The square of every real number is greater than 0.\n                 \n                 \n                 \n                  The square of a real number is greater than 0.\n                 \n                 \n                 \n                  If  , then  .\n                 \n                 \n\n       counterexample \n                 \n                 \n                  There exists a real number   such that  .\n                 \n                 \n                 \n                    for some real number  .\n                 \n                 \n                 \n                  There is a real number whose square equals 5.\n                 \n                 \n       \n        The second example is usually not used since it is not considered good writing practice to \n        start a sentence with a mathematical symbol.\n          If the universal set is  ,\n          then the truth set of the predicate\n           \n          is  .\n          So these are all true statements.\n       Negations of Quantified Statements negation of a quantified statement \n          \n      In  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n      we wrote negations of some quantified statements.\n      This is a very important mathematical activity.\n      As we will see in future sections,\n      it is sometimes just as important to be able to describe when some object does not satisfy a \n      certain property as it is to describe when the object satisfies the property.\n      Our next task is to learn how to write negations of quantified statements in a useful English \n      form.\n     \n      We first look at the negation of a statement involving a universal quantifier.\n      The general form for such a statement can be written as \n       ,\n      where   is an open sentence and   is the universal set for the variable \n       .\n      When we write\n       ,\n      we are asserting that the statement \n        is false.\n      This is equivalent to saying that the truth set of the open sentence   is not the \n      universal set.\n      That is, there exists an element   in the universal set   such that   \n      is false.\n      This in turn means that there exists an element   in   such that \n        is true,\n      which is equivalent to saying that \n        is true.\n      This explains why the following result is true:\n       .\n     \n      Similarly, when we write\n       ,\n      we are asserting that the statement \n        is false.\n      This is equivalent to saying that the truth set of the open sentence   is the \n      empty set.\n      That is, there is no element   in the universal set   such that   \n      is true.\n      This in turn means that for each element   in  ,\n        is true,\n      and this is equivalent to saying that \n        is true.\n      This explains why the following result is true:\n       .\n\n      We summarize these results in the following theorem.\n     \n          For any open sentence  ,\n           \n         Negations of Quantified Statements negation of a quantified statement \n          Consider the following statement:\n           .\n         \n          We can write this statement as an English sentence in several ways.\n          Following are two different ways to do so.\n           \n               \n                For each real number  ,  .\n               \n             \n               \n                If   is a real number,\n                then   is greater than or equal to  .\n               \n             \n\n          The second statement shows that in a conditional statement,\n          there is often a hidden universal quantifier.\n          This statement is false since there are real numbers   for which   is not \n          greater than or equal to  .\n          For example,\n          we could use   or  .\n         \n          This means that the negation must be true.\n          We can form the negation as follows:\n           .\n         \n          In most cases,\n          we want to write this negation in a way that does not use the negation symbol.\n          In this case,\n          we can now write the open sentence   as\n           . (That is, the negation of\n           is greater than or equal to \n          is\n           is less than. ) So we obtain the following:\n           .\n\n          The statement   \n          could be written in English as follows:\n\n               \n                There exists a real number   such that  .\n               \n\n               \n                There exists an   such that   is a real number and  .\n               \n\n         Negating Quantified Statements \n        For each of the following statements\n         \n             \n              Write the statement in the form of an English sentence that does not use the \n              symbols for quantifiers.\n             \n           \n             \n              Write the negation of the statement in a symbolic form

           \n                 \n             Counterexamples and Negations of Conditional Statements negation of a conditional statement counterexample counterexample \n      In the preceding example,\n      we also wrote the universally quantified statement as a conditional statement.\n      The number   is a counterexample for the statement If   is a real number,\n      then   is greater than or equal to  .\n      So the number   is an example that makes the hypothesis of the conditional statement \n      true and the conclusion false.\n      Remember that a conditional statement often contains a\n       hidden \n      universal quantifier.\n      Also, recall that in  \n      we saw that the negation of the conditional statement\n       If   then  \n      is the statement\n        and not  . \n      Symbolically, this can be written as follows:\n       .\n     \n      So when we specifically include the universal quantifier,\n      the symbolic form of the negation of a conditional statement is\n       \n     \n      That is,\n       .\n     Using Counterexamples \n          Use counterexamples to explain why each of the following statements is false.\n         \n          For each integer  ,\n            is a prime number.\n         \n            A counterexample is   since\n             , and 21 is not prime.\n           \n          For each real number  ,\n              if   is positive, then  .\n         \n            A counterexample is   since   is positive and\n              and  .\n           Quantifiers in Definitions quantifier perfect square perfect square \n      We frequently use the following steps to gain a better understanding of a definition.\n       \n           \n            Examples of natural numbers that are perfect squares are 1, 4, 9, and 81 since  ,\n             ,  , and  .\n           \n         \n           \n            Examples of natural numbers that are not perfect squares are 2, 5, 10, and 50.\n           \n         \n           \n            This definition gives two\n             conditions. \n            One is that the natural number   is a perfect square and the other is that \n            there exists a natural number   such that  .\n            The definition states that these mean the same thing.\n            So when we say that a natural number   is not a perfect square,\n            we need to negate the condition that  there exists a natural number   such that \n             .\n            We can use the symbolic form to do this.\n             \n            Notice that instead of writing  ,\n            we used the equivalent form of  .\n            This will be easier to translate into an English sentence.\n            So we can write,\n             \n              A natural number    is not a perfect square provided that for every natural number  ,  .\n             \n           \n         \n     \n      The preceding method illustrates a good method for trying to understand a new definition.\n      Most textbooks will simply define a concept and leave it to the reader to do the preceding steps.\n      Frequently, it is not sufficient just to read a definition and expect to understand the new term.\n      We must provide examples that satisfy the definition,\n      as well as examples that do not satisfy the definition,\n      and we must be able to write a coherent negation of the definition.\n     Multiples of Three multiple of 3 \n            Write this definition in symbolic form using quantifiers by completing the following:\n             \n              An integer   is a multiple of 3 provided that  .\n             \n           \n            An integer   is a multiple of 3 provided that \n             .\n           \n           Give several examples of integers\n            (including negative integers)\n            that are multiples of 3.\n         \n          Give several examples of integers\n            (including negative integers)\n            that are not multiples of 3.\n         \n          Use the symbolic form of the definition of a multiple of 3 to complete the following \n          sentence:\n             An integer   is not a multiple of 3 provided that  . \n         \n            An integer   is not a multiple of 3 provided that \n             .\n           \n          Without using the symbols for quantifiers,\n          complete the following sentence:\n           An integer   is not a multiple of 3 provided that  . \n         \n            An integer   is not a multiple of 3 provided that for every integer  ,\n             .\n           Statements with More than One Quantifier \n      When a predicate contains more than one variable,\n      each variable must be quantified to create a statement.\n      For example, assume the universal set is the set of integers,\n       ,\n      and let   be the predicate,\n       . \n      We can create a statement from this predicate in several ways.\n\n       \n

Consider the following conjecture:\n         Conjecture \n            Let  ,  ,\n            and   be integers with   and  .\n            If   divides   and   divides  ,\n            then   divides  .\n           \n       \n          Explain why the examples you generated in  \n           provide evidence that \n          this conjecture is true.\n         know-show table \n          State precisely what we would assume if we were trying to write a proof of \n          the preceding conjecture.\n         \n          Use the definition of\n           divides \n          to make some conclusions based on your assumptions in \n           .\n         \n          State precisely what we would be trying to prove if we were trying to write a proof \n          of the conjecture.\n         \n          Use the definition of divides to write an answer to the question, \n           How can we prove what we stated in ? \n         Beginning Activity 2: Calendars and Clocks \n        This activity is intended to help with understanding the concept of congruence,\n        which will be studied at the end of this section.\n     \n          Suppose that it is currently Tuesday.\n         \n              What day will it be 3 days from now?\n             \n              What day will it be 10 days from now?\n             \n              What day will it be 17 days from now?

Repeat this several times.\n             \n              What do the numbers you obtained in   \n              have in common?\n             \n          Suppose that we are using a twelve-hour clock with no distinction between \n              A.M. and P.M. Also,\n              suppose that the current time is 5:00.\n         \n              What time will it be 4 hours from now?\n             \n              What time will it be 16 hours from now?\n              What time will it be 28 hours from now?\n             \n              Find several other natural numbers   such that it will be 9:00 \n                  hours from now.\n             \n              Create a list\n                (in increasing order)\n                of the numbers  ,\n                and the numbers you generated in  .\n                Pick any two numbers from this list and subtract one from the other.\n                Repeat this several times.\n             \n              What do the numbers you obtained in   \n              have in common?\n             \n          This is a continuation of  .\n          Suppose that it is currently Tuesday.\n         \n              What day was it 4 days ago?\n             \n              What day was it 11 days ago?\n              What day was it 18 days ago?\n             \n              Find several other natural numbers   such that it was Friday   days ago.\n             \n              Create a list\n                (in increasing order)\n                consisting of the numbers  ,\n                the opposites of the numbers you generated in \n                 \n                and the positive numbers in the list from \n                 .\n                Pick any two numbers from this list and subtract one from the other.\n                Repeat this several times.\n             \n              What do the numbers you obtained in \n                have in common?\n             Some Mathematical Terminology \n      In  ,\n      we introduced the idea of a direct proof.\n      Since then, we have used some common terminology in mathematics without much explanation.\n      Before we proceed further,\n      we will discuss some frequently used mathematical terms.\n     proof undefined terms axiom A Note About Axioms in This Text \n          The closure properties of the number systems discussed in  \n          and the properties of the number systems in  \n          are being used as axioms in this text.\n         definition conjecture theorem proposition lemma corollary Constructing Mathematical Proofs \n      To create a proof of a theorem,\n      we must use correct logical reasoning and mathematical statements that we already accept as true.\n      These statements include axioms, definitions,\n      theorems, lemmas, and corollaries.\n     know-show table \n      Please remember that when we start the process of writing a proof,\n      we are essentially\n       reporting the news. \n      That is, we have already discovered the proof,\n      and now we need to report it.\n      This reporting often does not describe the process of discovering the news\n      (the investigative portion of the process).\n     \n      Quite often, the first step is to develop a conjecture.\n      This is often done after working within certain objects for some time.\n      This is what we did in  Beginning Activity 1 \n      when we used examples to provide evidence that the following conjecture is true:\n       \n           Conjecture \n           \n            Let  ,  , and   by integers with   and \n             . If   divides   and   divides  , then \n              divides  .\n           \n         \n     \n      Before we try to prove a conjecture,\n      we should make sure we have explored some examples.\n      This simply means to construct some specific examples where the integers  ,\n       ,\n      and   satisfy the hypothesis of the conjecture in order to see if they also satisfy the \n      conclusion.\n      We did this for this conjecture in  Beginning Activity 1 .\n     \n      We will now start a know-show table for this conjecture.\n     Step Know Reason ,  ,  , \n          and   Hypothesis Step Show Reason \n      The backward question we ask is,\n       How can we prove that   divides  ? \n      One answer is to use the definition and show that there exists an integer   \n      such that  .\n      This could be step   in the know-show table.\n     \n      We now have to prove that a certain integer   exists,\n      so we ask the question,\n       How do we prove that this integer exists? \n      When we are at such a stage in the backward process of a proof,\n      we usually turn to what is known in order to prove that the object exists or to find or \n      construct the object we are trying to prove exists.\n      We often say that we try to\n       construct \n      the object or at least prove it exists from the known information.\n      So at this point,\n      we go to the forward part of the proof to try to prove that there exists an integer \n        such that  .\n     \n      The forward question we ask is,\n       What can we conclude from the facts that\n        and  ? \n      Again, using the definition,\n      we know that there exist integers   and   such that\n        and  .\n      This could be step   in the know-show table.\n     \n      The key now is to determine how to get from   to  .\n      That is, can we use the conclusions that the integers   and   exist in order to \n      prove that the integer  \n      (from the backward process)\n      exists.\n      Using the equation  ,\n      we can substitute   for   in the second equation,\n       .\n      This gives\n       .\n     \n      The last step used the associative property of multiplication.\n      (See  .)\n      This shows that   is equal to   times some integer.\n      (This is because   is an integer by the closure property for integers.)\n       So although we did not use the letter  ,\n      we have arrived at step  .\n      The completed know-show table follows.\n     Step Know Reason ,  ,  ,\n            and  Hypothesis \n         Definition of\n           divides \n         Substitution for  Associative property of  multiplication Step   and the closure  \n         properties of the integers Definition of\n           divides \n         construction method for a proof \n      We can now report the news by writing a formal proof.\n     \n          Let  ,  ,\n          and   be integers with   and  .\n          If   divides   and   divides  ,\n          then   divides  .\n         \n        We assume that  ,  ,\n        and   are integers with   and  .\n        We further assume that   divides   and that   divides  .\n        We will prove that   divides  .\n       \n        Since   divides   and   divides  ,\n        there exist integers   and   such that\n         \n       \n        We can now substitute the expression for   from equation  \n        into equation  .\n        This gives\n         .\n       \n        Using the associate property for multiplication,\n        we can rearrange the right side of the last equation to obtain\n         .\n       \n        Because both   and   are integers,\n        and since the integers are closed under multiplication,\n        we know that  .\n        Therefore, the previous equation proves that   divides  .\n        Consequently, we have proven that whenever  ,  ,\n        and   are integers with   and   such that   divides \n          and   divides  ,\n        then   divides  . \n       Writing Guidelines for Equation Numbers writing guidelines equation numbers \n      If it is necessary to refer to an equation later in a proof,\n      that equation should be centered and displayed.\n      It should then be given a number.\n      The number for the equation should be written in parentheses on the same line as the \n      equation at the right-hand margin as in shown in the following example.\n       \n      Since   is an odd integer,\n      there exists an integer   such that\n       \n       .\n\n    Later in the proof, there may be a line such as\n     \n    Then, using the result in equation  , we obtain  .\n     \n\n    Notice that we did not number every equation in  . \n    We should only number those equations we will be referring to later in the proof, and we \n    should only number equations when it is necessary.  For example, instead of numbering an \n    equation, it is often better to use a phrase such as,\n     the previous equation proves that  \n    or\n     we can rearrange the terms on the right side of the previous equation. \n    Also, note that the word\n     equation \n    is not capitalized when we are referring to an equation by number.  Although it \n    may be appropriate to use a capital\n     E, \n    the usual convention in mathematics is not to capitalize.\n     A Property of Divisors \n          Give at least four different examples of integers  ,\n           ,\n          and   with   such that   divides   and   \n          divides  .\n         \n          For each example in  , calculate the sum  .\n          Does the integer   divide the sum  ?\n         \n            For each example in Part (1),\n            the integer   divides the sum  .\n           \n          Construct a know-show table for the following proposition: For all integers  ,\n           ,\n          and   with  ,\n          if   divides   and   divides  ,\n          then   divides  .\n         \n            Conjecture: For all integers  ,  ,\n            and   with  ,\n            if   divides   and   divides  ,\n            then   divides  .\n           \n            A Know-show table for a proof of the conjecture in Part (3).\n

of\n                   divides \n                 Step Show Reason \n           Using Counterexamples counterexample \n          \n      In   and so far in this section,\n      our focus has been on proving statements that involve universal quantifiers.\n      However, another important skill for mathematicians is to be able to recognize when \n      a statement is false and then to be able to prove that it is false.\n      For example,\n      suppose we want to know if the following proposition is true or false.\n       \n        For each integer  , if 5 divides  , then 5 divides \n         .\n       \n     \n      Suppose we start trying to prove this proposition.\n      In the backward process,\n      we would say that in order to prove that 5 divides  ,\n      we can show that there exists an integer   such that\n       .\n     \n      For the forward process,\n      we could say that since 5 divides  ,\n      we know that there exists an integer   such that\n       .\n     \n      The problem is that there is no straightforward way to use   to prove  .\n      At this point,\n      it would be a good idea to try some examples for   and try to find situations in \n      which the hypothesis of the proposition is true.\n      (In fact, this should have been done before we started trying to prove the proposition.)\n      The following table summarizes the results of some of these explorations with values for  .\n     Does 5 divide  Does 5 divide  1 0 yes 0 yes 2 3 no 1 no 3 8 no 2 no 4 15 yes 3 no counterexample \n      When using a counterexample to prove a statement is false,\n      we do not use the term\n       proof \n      since we reserve a proof for proving a proposition is true.\n      We could summarize our work as follows:\n    \n     Conjecture \n        For each integer  ,\n        if 5 divides  ,\n        then 5 divides  .\n       \n        The integer   is a counterexample that proves this conjecture is false.\n        Notice that when  ,\n          and 5 divides 15.\n        Hence, the hypothesis of the conjecture is true in this case.\n        In addition,\n          and 5 does not divide 3 and so the conclusion of the conjecture is \n        false in this case.\n        Since this is an example where the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false,\n        the conjecture is false.\n       \n\n      As a general rule of thumb,\n      anytime we are trying to decide if a proposition is true or false,\n      it is a good idea to try some examples first.\n      The examples that are chosen should be ones in which the hypothesis of the proposition is true.\n      If one of these examples makes the conclusion false,\n      then we have found a counterexample and we know the proposition is false.\n      If all of the examples produce a true conclusion,\n      then we have evidence that the proposition is true and can try to write a proof.\n     Using a Counterexample counterexample \n        Use a counterexample to prove the following statement is false.\n         \n          For all integers   and  , if 5 divides   or 5 divides  , \n          then 5 divides  .\n         \n       \n          A counterexample for this statement will be values of   and   for which \n          5 divides   or 5 divides  ,\n          and 5 does not divide  .\n          One counterexample for the statement is   and  .\n          For these values,\n          the hyothesis is true since 5 divides   and the conclusion is false since\n            and 5 does not divide 26.\n         Congruence congruence  \n      What mathematicians call congruence is a concept used to describe cycles in the world of \n      the integers.\n      For example,\n      the day of the week is a cyclic phenomenon in that the day of the week repeats every seven days.\n      The time of the day is a cyclic phenomenon because it repeats every 12 hours if we use a \n      12-hour clock or every 24 hours if we use a 24-hour clock.\n      We explored these two cyclic phenomena in  Beginning Activity 2 .\n     \n      Similar to what we saw in  Beginning Activity 2 ,\n      if it is currently Monday,\n      then it will be Wednesday 2 days from now, 9 days from now, 16 days from now, 23 days from now,\n      and so on.\n      In addition,\n      it was Wednesday 5 days ago, 12 days ago, 19 days ago,\n      and so on.\n      Using negative numbers for time in the past,\n      we generate the following list of numbers:\n       .\n     \n      Notice that if we subtract any number in the list above from any other number in that list,\n      we will obtain a multiple of 7.\n      For example,\n       .\n      is congruent to\n            modulo  \n      This means that in order to find integers that are congruent to   modulo  ,\n      we only need to add multiples of   to  .\n      For example,\n      to find integers that are congruent to 2 modulo 5, we add multiples of 5 to 2.\n      This gives the following list:\n       .\n     \n      We can also write this using set notation and say that\n       .\n     Congruence Modulo 8 \n            Determine at least eight different integers that are congruent to 5 modulo 8.\n           \n              Some integers that are congruent to 5 modulo 8 are  , and 21.\n             \n            Use set builder notation and the roster method to specify the set of all integers \n            that are congruent to 5 modulo 8.\n           \n               .\n             \n            Choose two integers that are congruent to 5 modulo 8 and add them.\n            Then repeat this for at least five other pairs of integers that are congruent to 5 \n            modulo 8.\n           \n              For example,  ,\n               ,  .\n             \n            Explain why all of the sums that were obtained in   \n            are congruent to 2 modulo 8.\n           \n              If we subtract 2 from any of the sums obtained in  , \n              the result will be a multiple of 8.\n              This means that the sum is congruent to 2 modulo 8.\n              For example,  ,\n               ,  .\n             \n      We will study the concept of congruence modulo   in much more detail later in the text.\n      For now, we will work with the definition of congruence modulo   in the context of proofs.\n      For example,\n      all of the examples used in  \n      should provide evidence that the following proposition is true.\n     \n          For all integers   and  ,\n          if   and  ,\n          then  .\n         Proving  \n        We will use\n         backward questions \n        and\n         forward questions \n        to help construct a proof for  .\n        So, we might ask,\n         How do we prove that  ? \n        One way to answer this is to use the definition of congruence and state that\n          provided that 8 divides  .\n       \n          Use   to determine a way to prove that 8 divides  .\n         \n            To prove that 8 divides  ,\n            we can prove that there exists an integer   such that  .\n           \n          We now turn to what we know and ask,\n           What can we conclude from the assumptions that\n            and  ? \n          We can again use the definition of congruence and conclude that 8 divides   \n          and 8 divides  .\n         \n          Use   to make conclusions based on the facts that 8 divides \n            and 8 divides  .\n         \n            Since 8 divides   and  ,\n            there exist integers   and   such that\n              and  .\n           \n          Solve an equation from   for   and for  .\n         \n              and  .\n           \n           Use the results from  ) to prove that 8 divides  .\n         \n             .\n           \n          Write a proof for  .\n         \n                Let   and   be integers and assume that\n                  and  .\n                We will prove that  .\n                Since 8 divides   and  ,\n                there exist integers   and   such that\n                  and  .\n                We then see that\n                 \n               \n                By the closure properties of the integers,\n                  is an integer and so the last equation proves that 8 divides   and hence,\n                 .\n                This proves that if   and  ,\n                then  \n               Additional Writing Guidelines writing guidelines \n          \n      We will now be writing many proofs,\n      and it is important to make sure we write according to accepted guidelines so that our \n      proofs may be understood by others.\n      Some writing guidelines were introduced in  .\n      The first four writing guidelines given below can be considered general guidelines,\n      and the last three can be considered as technical guidelines specific to writing in mathematics.\n     \n         Know Your Audience \n         \n          Every writer should have a clear idea of the intended audience for a piece of writing.\n        In that way,\n        the writer can give the right amount of information at the proper level of sophistication to \n        communicate effectively.\n        This is especially true for mathematical writing.\n        For example,\n        if a mathematician is writing a solution to a textbook problem for a solutions manual for \n        instructors,\n        the writing would be brief with many details omitted.\n        However, if the writing was for a students' solution manual,\n        more details would be included.\n         \n       \n         Use complete sentences and proper paragraph structure \n         \n          Good grammar is an important part of any writing.\n        Therefore, conform to the accepted rules of grammar.\n        Pay careful attention to the structure of sentences.\n        Write proofs using  complete sentences \n        but avoid run-on sentences.\n        Also, do not forget punctuation,\n        and always use a spell checker when using a word processor.\n         \n       \n         Keep it simple \n         \n          It is often difficult to understand a mathematical argument no matter how well it is written.\n        Do not let your writing help make it more difficult for the reader.\n        Use simple, declarative sentences and short paragraphs,\n        each with a simple point.\n         \n       \n         Write a first draft of your proof and then revise it \n         \n          Remember that a proof is written so that readers are able to read and understand the \n        reasoning in the proof.\n        Be clear and concise.\n        Include details but do not ramble.\n        Do not be satisfied with the first draft of a proof.\n        Read it over and refine it.\n        Just like any worthwhile activity,\n        learning to write mathematics well takes practice and hard work.\n        This can be frustrating.\n        Everyone can be sure that there will be some proofs that are difficult to construct,\n        but remember that proofs are a very important part of mathematics.\n        So work hard and have fun.\n         \n       \n         Do not use   for multiplication or ^ for exponents \n         \n        Leave this type of notation for writing computer code.\n        The use of this notation makes it difficult for humans to read.\n        In addition,\n        avoid using   for division when using a complex fraction.\n       \n       \n         For example,\n          it is very difficult to read  ;\n          the fraction\n           \n          is much easier to read.\n       \n       \n         Do not use a mathematical symbol at the beginning of a sentence. \n         \n          For example, we should not write,\n         Let   be an integer.\n          is an odd integer provided that   . \n        Many people find this hard to read and often have to re-read it to understand it.\n        It would be better to write,\n         An integer   is an odd integer provided that   . \n         \n       \n         Use English and minimize the use of cumbersome notation \n         \n          Do not use the special symbols for quantifiers  \n        (for all),\n         \n        (there exists),\n         \n        (such that),\n        or   (therefore) in formal mathematical writing.\n        It is often easier to write, and usually easier to read,\n        if the English words are used instead of the symbols.\n        For example, why make the reader interpret\n           \n        when it is possbile to write\n         \n          For each real number  ,\n          there exists a real number   such that  ,\n         \n        or, more succinctly (if appropriate),\n         \n          Every real number has an additive inverse.\n         \n         \n       \n          Prove each of the following statements:\n         \n              For all integers  ,  ,\n            and   with  ,\n            if   and  ,\n            then  .\n             \n                Since   and  , there exist integers   and \n                  such that   and  . Hence,\n                 \n                Since   is an integer (by the closure properties of the integers), \n                the last equation implies that   divides  .\n               \n              For each  ,\n              if   is an odd integer,\n              then   is an odd integer.\n             \n                What do you need to do in order to prove that   is odd?  Notice that \n                if   is an odd integer, then there exists an integer   such that \n                 .  Remember that to prove that   is an odd integer, \n                you need to prove that there exists an integer   such that  .\n                This can also be approached as follows:  If   is odd, then  by \n                 ,   is odd. Now use the fact that \n                 .\n               \n              For each integer  ,\n              if 4 divides  , then 4 divides  .\n             \n                If 4 divides  , then there exists an integer   such \n                that   and so\n                 .  Use algebra to rewrite \n                 .\n               \n          For each of the following,\n          use a counterexample to prove the statement is false.\n         \n              For each odd natural number  ,\n              if  , then 3 divides  .\n             \n                The natural number   is a counterexample since   is odd,\n                 ,   and 3 does not divide 80.\n               \n              For each natural number  ,\n                is a prime number.\n             \n              For all real numbers   and  ,\n               .\n             \n              For each integer  ,\n              if 4 divides  ,\n              then 4 divides  .\n             \n                The integer   is a counterexample since\n                  and  .\n                Since 4 divides 8 and 4 does not divide 2, this is an example where the hypothesis of \n                the conditional statement is true and the conclusion is false.\n               \n          Determine if each of the following statements is true or false.\n          If a statement is true,\n          then write a formal proof of that statement, and if it is false,\n          then provide a counterexample that shows it is false.\n         \n              For all integers  ,  ,\n            and   with  ,\n              if  , then  .\n             \n              For all integers   and   with  ,\n              if  ,\n              then   or  .\n             \n                This statement is false.\n                One counterexample is   and   since this is an example \n                where the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.\n               \n              For all integers  ,  ,\n              and   with  ,\n              if   divides   and   divides  ,\n              then   divides  .\n             \n              For each integer  ,\n              if 7 divides  ,\n              then 7 divides  .\n             \n                This statement is false.\n                One counterexample is  .\n                Since   and  ,\n                this is an example where the hypothesis of the conditional statement is true \n                and the conclusion is false.\n               \n              For every integer  ,   is an odd integer.\n             \n                Make sure you first try some examples.\n                How do you prove that an integer is an odd integer?\n               \n              For every odd integer  ,\n                is an odd integer.\n             \n                The following algebra may be useful.\n                 .\n               \n              For all integers  ,  ,\n              and   with  ,\n              if   divides both   and  ,\n              then   divides  .\n             \n                This statement is false.\n                One counterexample is  ,\n                 , and  .\n                Why is this a counterexample?\n               \n              For all integers  ,  ,\n              and   with  ,\n              if  , then   or  .\n             \n          Complete the following.\n         \n          If   and   are integers and  ,\n            explain why   or  .\n         \n            If  , then   and   are both divisors of  , and \n            the only divisors of   are   and  .\n           \n          Is the following proposition true or false?\n             \n              For all nonzero integers   and  , if   and  , \n              then  .\n             \n         \n              is useful in proving this.\n           \n          Prove the following proposition:\n           \n            Let   be an integer.

Have we completed the proof \n            of the following proposition?\n             \n              For each integer  ,   is an odd integer if and only if   is \n              an odd integer.\n             \n            Explain.\n           Review of Direct Proofs direct proof proof direct \n      In  \n      and  , we studied direct proofs\n          \n      of mathematical statements.\n      Most of the statements we prove in mathematics are conditional statements that can be written \n      in the form  .\n      A direct proof of a statement of the form   is based on the definition that a \n      conditional statement can only be false when the hypothesis,\n       , is true and the conclusion,  , is false.\n      Thus, if the conclusion is true whenever the hypothesis is true,\n      then the conditional statement must be true.\n      So, in a direct proof,\n       \n           \n            We start by assuming that   is true.\n           \n         \n           \n            From this assumption, we logically deduce that   is true.\n           \n         \n\n      We have used the so-called forward and backward method to discover how to logically \n      deduce   from the assumption that   is true.\n     Proof Using the Contrapositive contrapositive proof contrapositive     \n      As we saw in  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n      it is sometimes difficult to construct a direct proof of a conditional statement.\n      This is one reason we studied logical equivalencies in  .\n      Knowing that two expressions are logically equivalent tells us that if we prove one,\n      then we have also proven the other.\n      In fact, once we know the truth value of a statement,\n      then we know the truth value of any other statement that is logically equivalent to it.\n     \n      One of the most useful logical equivalencies in this regard is that a conditional statement \n        is logically equivalent to its contrapositive,\n       .\n      This means that if we prove the contrapositive of the conditional statement,\n      then we have proven the conditional statement.\n      The following are some important points to remember.\n       \n           \n            A conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive.\n           \n         \n           \n            Use a direct proof to prove that   is true.\n           \n         \n           \n            Caution: One difficulty with this type of proof is in the formation of correct negations.\n            (We need to be very careful doing this.)\n           \n         \n           \n            We might consider using a proof by contrapositive when the statements   and \n              are stated as negations.\n           \n         \n     Writing Guidelines writing guidelines \n      One of the basic rules of writing mathematical proofs is to keep the reader informed.\n      So when we prove a result using the contrapositive,\n      we indicate this within the first few lines of the proof.\n      For example,\n       \n           \n            We will prove this theorem by proving its contrapositive.\n           \n         \n           \n            We will prove the contrapositive of this statement.\n           \n         \n     \n      In addition,\n      make sure the reader knows the status of every assertion that you make.\n      That is, make sure you state whether an assertion is an assumption of the theorem,\n      a previously proven result, a well-known result,\n      or something from the reader's mathematical background.\n      Following is a completed proof of a statement from \n       Beginning Activity 1 .\n     \n          For each integer  ,\n          if   is an even integer,\n          then   is an even integer.\n         \n        We will prove this result by proving the contrapositive of the statement, which is\n         \n          For each integer  , if   is an odd integer, then   is an odd integer.\n         \n       \n        However, in  ,\n        we have already proven that if   and   are odd integers,\n        then   is an odd integer.\n        So using  ,\n        we can conclude that if   is an odd integer,\n        then  , or  , is an odd integer.\n        We have thus proved the contrapositive of the theorem,\n        and consequently,\n        we have proved that if   is an even integer,\n        then   is an even integer. \n       Using Other Logical Equivalencies \n      As was noted in  ,\n      there are several different logical equivalencies.\n      Fortunately,\n      there are only a small number that we often use when trying to write proofs,\n      and many of these are listed in  \n      at the end of  .\n      We will illustrate the use of one of these logical equivalencies with the following proposition:\n       \n        For all real numbers   and  , if   and  , then \n         .\n       \n     \n      First, notice that the hypothesis and the conclusion of the conditional statement are stated \n      in the form of negations.\n      This suggests that we consider the contrapositive.\n      Care must be taken when we negate the hypothesis since it is a conjunction.\n      We use one of De Morgan's Laws as follows:\n       .\n     Using Another Logical Equivalency \n          In English, write the contrapositive of,\n           For all real numbers   and  ,\n          if   and  , then  . \n         \n            For all real numbers   and  ,\n            if  , then  .\n           \n          The contrapositive is a conditional statement in the form \n           .\n          The difficulty is that there is not much we can do with the hypothesis\n            since we know nothing else about the real numbers \n            and  .\n          However, if we knew that   was not equal to zero,\n          then we could multiply both sides of the equation   by  .\n          This suggests that we consider using the following logical equivalency based on a\n          result in  :\n           .\n         \n          In English, use this logical equivalency to write a statement that is logically \n          equivalent to the contrapositive from  .\n         \n            For all real numbers   and  ,\n            if   and  ,  .\n           \n          The logical equivalency in   makes sense \n          because if we are trying to prove  ,\n          we only need to prove that at least one of   or   is true.\n          So the idea is to prove that if   is false,\n          then   must be true.\n         \n          Use the ideas presented in the progress check to complete the proof of the following \n          proposition.\n           \n                For all real numbers   and  ,\n                if   and  , then  .\n               \n                We will prove the contrapositive of this proposition,\n                which is \n                 \n                  For all real numbers   and  ,\n                  if  , then  .\n                 \n               \n                This contrapositive, however,\n                is logically equivalent to the following: \n                 \n                  For all real numbers   and  ,\n                  if   and  , then  .\n                 \n                To prove this,\n                we let   and   be real numbers and assume that \n                  and  .\n                We can then multiply both sides of the equation   by  .\n                This gives \n                 \n                 \n               \n                Therefore,  .\n                This completes the proof of a statement that is logically equivalent to the \n                contrapositive,\n                and hence,\n                we have proven the proposition. \n              \n         \n            This gives\n             .\n            We now use the associative property on the left side of this equation and simplify \n            both sides of the equation to obtain\n             \n            Therefore,   and this completes the proof of a statement that is \n            logically equivalent to the contrapositive.\n            Hence, we have proved the proposition.\n           Proofs of Biconditional Statements proof biconditional statement biconditional statement proof of \n      In  Beginning Activity 2 ,\n      we used the following logical equivalency:\n       .\n\n      This logical equivalency suggests one method for proving a biconditional statement written in \n      the form\n        if and only if  . \n      This method is to construct separate proofs of the two conditional statements   \n      and  .\n      For example, since we have now proven each of the following:\n       \n           \n            For each integer  , if   is an even integer,\n

in all circumstances,\n        and a contradiction is necessarily false in all circumstances.\n       \n            Use truth tables to explain why\n              is a tautology and \n              is a contradiction.\n           proof by contradiction. \n        A logical basis for the contradiction method of proof is the tautology\n         ,\n        where   is a statement and   is a contradiction.\n        The following truth table establishes this tautology.\n         T F F T T F F T F T \n        This tautology shows that if\n          leads to a contradiction,\n        then

contradiction,\n        then we have proved statement  .\n        So if we want to prove a statement   using a proof by contradiction,\n        we assume that   is true and show that this leads to a contradiction.\n       \n        When we try to prove the conditional statement,  If   then \n          using a proof by contradiction,\n        we must assume that   is false and show that this leads

that \\mbox{ } is false,\n        we are assuming that   is true and   is false.\n        If we can prove that this leads to a contradiction,\n        then we have shown that   is false and hence that \n          is true.\n       \n            Give a counterexample to show that the following statement is false.\n               \n              For each real number  ,\n               .\n               \n           \n            When a statement is false,\n            it is sometimes possible to add an assumption that will yield a true statement.\n            This is usually done by using a conditional statement.\n            So instead of working with the statement in  ,\n            we will work with a related statement that is obtained by adding an assumption\n            (or assumptions)\n            to the hypothesis.\n             \n            For each real number  ,\n            if  , then  .\n             \n            To begin a proof by contradiction for this statement,\n            we need to assume the negation of the statement.\n            To do this, we need to negate the entire statement, including the quantifier.\n            Recall that the negation of a statement with a universal quantifier is a statement that \n            contains an existential quantifier.\n            (See  .)\n            With this in mind,\n            carefully write down all assumptions made at the beginning of a proof by contradiction \n            for this statement.\n           Beginning Activity 2: Constructing a Proof by Contradiction \n          Consider the following proposition:\n\n           \n                For all real numbers   and  , if  ,\n                 ,\n                then  .\n               \n          To start a proof by contradiction,\n          we assume that this statement is false;\n          that is, we assume the negation is true.\n          Because this is a statement with a universal quantifier,\n          we assume that there exist real numbers   and   such that  ,\n            and that  .\n          (Notice that the negation of the conditional sentence is a conjunction.)\n       \n        For this proof by contradiction,\n        we will only work with the know column of a know-show table.\n        This is because we do not have a specific goal.\n        The goal is to obtain some contradiction,\n        but we do not know ahead of time what that contradiction will be.\n        Using our assumptions,\n        we can perform algebraic operations on the inequality\n         \n        until we obtain a contradiction.\n       \n            Try the following algebraic operations on the \n            inequality in  .\n            First, multiply both sides of the inequality by  ,\n            which is a positive real number since   and  .\n            Then, subtract   from both sides of this inequality and finally,\n            factor the left side of the resulting inequality.\n           \n            Explain why the last inequality you obtained leads to a contradiction.\n           \n        By obtaining a contradiction,\n        we have proved that the proposition cannot be false, and hence,\n        must be true.\n       Writing Guidelines: Keep the Reader Informed writing guidelines \n      A very important piece of information about a proof is the method of proof to be used.\n      So when we are going to prove a result using the contrapositive or a proof by contradiction,\n      we indicate this at the start of the proof.\n       \n           \n            We will prove this result by proving the contrapositive of the statement.\n           \n         \n           \n            We will prove this statement using a proof by contradiction.\n           \n         \n           \n            We will use a proof by contradiction.\n           \n         \n     \n      We have discussed the logic behind a proof by contradiction in the beginning activities for \n      this section.\n      The basic idea for a proof by contradiction of a proposition is to assume the proposition \n      is false and show that this leads to a contradiction.\n      We can then conclude that the proposition cannot be false,\n      and hence,\n      must be true.\n      When we assume a proposition is false,\n      we are, in effect, assuming that its negation is true.\n      This is one reason why it is so important to be able to write negations of \n      propositions quickly and correctly.\n      We will illustrate the process with the proposition discussed in \n       Beginning Activity 1 .\n     \n          For each real number  ,\n          if  , then  .\n         \n        We will use a proof by contradiction.\n        So we assume that the proposition is false,\n        or that there exists a real number   such that   and\n         .\n       \n        We note that since  ,\n        we can conclude that   and that  .\n        Hence,   and if we multiply both sides of  \n        inequality   by  ,\n        we obtain\n         .\n       \n        We can now use algebra to rewrite the last inequality as follows:\n         \n       \n        However,   is a real number and the last inequality says that a real number \n        squared is less than zero.\n        This is a contradiction since the square of any real number must be greater than or \n        equal to zero.\n        Hence, the proposition cannot be false,\n        and we have proved that for each real number  ,\n        if  , then  . \n       Starting a Proof by Contradiction \n        One of the most important parts of a proof by contradiction is the very first part,\n        which is to state the assumptions that will be used in the proof by contradiction.\n        This usually involves writing a clear negation of the proposition to be proven.\n        Review De Morgan's Laws and the negation of a conditional statement in \n         .\n        (See  .)\n        Also, review  \n        and then write a negation of each of the following statements.\n        (Remember that a real number is\n         not irrational \n        means that the real number is rational.)\n       \n          For each real number  ,\n          if   is irrational, then   is irrational.\n         \n            There exists a real number   such that   is irrational and \n              is rational.\n           \n          For each real number  ,\n            is irrational or   \n          is irrational.\n         \n            There exists a real number   such that\n              is rational and   \n            is rational.\n           \n          For all integers   and  ,\n          if 5 divides  , then 5 divides   or 5 divides  .\n         \n            There exist integers   and   such that 5 divides   and 5 does \n            not divide   and 5 does not divide  .\n           \n          For all real numbers   and  ,\n          if   and  ,\n          then  .\n         \n            There exist real numbers   and   such that   and   \n            and  .\n           Important Note \n      A proof by contradiction is often used to prove a conditional statement\n        when a direct proof has not been found and it is relatively easy to form the \n      negation of the proposition.\n      The advantage of a proof by contradiction is that we have an additional assumption with \n      which to work\n      (since we assume not only   but also  ).\n      The disadvantage is that there is no well-defined goal to work toward.\n      The goal is simply to obtain some contradiction.\n      There usually is no way of telling beforehand what that contradiction will be,\n      so we have to stay alert for a possible absurdity.\n      Thus, when we set up a know-show table for a proof by contradiction,\n      we really only work with the know portion of the table.\n     Exploration and a Proof by Contradiction \n        Consider the following proposition:\n         \n          For each integer  , if  , then  .\n         \n       \n          Determine at least five different integers that are congruent to 2 modulo 4, and \n          determine at least five different integers that are congruent to 3 modulo 6.\n          Are there any integers that are in both of these lists?\n         \n            Some integers that are congruent to 2 modulo 4 are  ,\n            and some integers that are congruent to 3 modulo 6 are:\n             .\n            There are no integers that are in both of the lists.\n           \n          For this proposition,\n          why does it seem reasonable to try a proof by contradiction?\n         \n            For this proposition,\n            it is reasonable to try a proof by contradiction since the conclusion is stated as a negation.\n           \n          For this proposition,\n          state clearly the assumptions that need to be made at the beginning of a proof by \n          contradiction,\n          and then use a proof by contradiction to prove this proposition.\n         \n            We will use a proof by contradiction.\n            Let   and assume that\n              and that  .\n            Since  ,\n            we know that 4 divides  .\n            Hence, there exists an integer   such that\n             .\n           \n            We can also use the assumption that\n              to conclude that 6 divides   and that there \n            exists an integer   such that\n             .\n           \n            If we now solve equation   and \n            equation   for   and set the two expressions equal to each other,\n            we obtain\n             .\n           \n            However, this equation can be rewritten as\n             .\n           \n            Since   is an integer and   is an integer,\n            this last equation is a contradiction since the left side is an even integer and the \n            right side is an odd integer.\n            Hence, we have proven that if  ,\n            then  .\n           Proving that Something Does Not Exist \n      In mathematics,\n      we sometimes need to prove that something does not exist or that something is not possible.\n      Instead of trying to construct a direct proof,\n      it is sometimes easier to use a proof by contradiction so that we can assume that the \n      something exists.\n      For example,\n      suppose we want to prove the following proposition:\n     \n          For all integers   and  ,\n          if   and   are odd integers,\n          then there does not exist an integer   such that  .\n         \n      Notice that the conclusion involves trying to prove that an integer with a certain property \n      does not exist.\n      If we use a proof by contradiction,\n      we can assume that such an integer   exists.\n      This gives us more with which to work.\n     \n        Complete the following proof of  :\n       \n        Proof: We will use a proof by contradiction.\n        So we assume that there exist integers   and   such that   and \n          are odd and there exists an integer   such that  .\n        Since   and   are odd,\n        there exist integers   and   such that\n          and  .\n       \n          Use the assumptions that   and   are odd to prove that\n            is even and hence,   is even.\n          (See  .)\n         \n             .\n           \n          We can now conclude that   is even.\n          (See  .)\n          So there exists an integer   such that  .\n          If we substitute for  ,  ,\n          and   in the equation  , we obtain\n           .\n         \n          Use the previous equation to obtain a contradiction. \n         \n            One way is to use algebra to obtain an equation where the left side is an odd integer \n            and the right side is an even integer.\n           \n            Using algebra to rewrite the last equation, we obtain\n             .\n            If we divide both sides of this equation by 2, we see that \n              or\n             .\n            However, the left side of the last equation is an odd integer and the right side \n            is an even integer.\n            This is a contradiction,\n            and so we have proved that for all integers   and  ,\n            if   and   are odd integers,\n            then there does not exist an integer   such that  .\n           Rational and Irrational Numbers \n      One of the most important ways to classify real numbers is as a rational number or an \n      irrational number.\n      Following is the definition of rational\n      (and irrational)\n      numbers given in   from  .\n      \n     Definition rational number number rational irrational numbers rational number irrational number \n      This may seem like a strange distinction because most people are quite familiar with the \n      rational numbers (fractions) but the irrational numbers seem a bit unusual.\n      However, there are many irrational numbers such as  ,\n       ,\n       ,  , and the number  .\n      We are discussing these matters now because we will soon prove that\n        is irrational in  .\n     \n      We use the symbol   to stand for the set of rational numbers.\n      There is no standard symbol for the set of irrational numbers.\n      Perhaps one reason for this is because of the closure properties of the rational numbers.\n      We introduced closure properties in  ,\n      and the rational numbers   are closed under addition,\n      subtraction,\n      multiplication, and division by nonzero rational numbers.\n      This means that if  , then\n       \n           \n             ,  , and   are in  ; and\n           \n         \n           \n            If  , then   is in  .\n           \n         \n     \n      The basic reasons for these facts are that if we add, subtract,\n      multiply, or divide two fractions, the result is a fraction.\n      One reason we do not have a symbol for the irrational numbers is that the irrational numbers \n      are not closed under these operations.\n      For example, we will prove that\n        is irrational in  .\n      We then see that\n       ,\n      which shows that the product of irrational numbers can be rational and the quotient of \n      irrational numbers can be rational.\n     \n      It is also important to realize that every integer is a rational number since any integer \n      can be written as a fraction.\n      For example, we can write  .\n      In general, if  ,\n      then  ,\n      and hence,  .\n     \n      Because the rational numbers are closed under the standard operations and the \n      definition of an irrational number simply says that the number is not rational,\n      we often use a proof by contradiction to prove that a number is irrational.\n      This is illustrated in the next proposition.\n     \n          For all real numbers   and  ,\n          if   is rational and   and   is irrational,\n          then   is irrational.\n         \n        We will use a proof by contradiction.\n        So we assume that there exist real numbers   and   such that   is rational,\n         ,\n          is irrational, and   is rational.\n        Since  , we can divide by  ,\n        and since the rational numbers are closed under division by nonzero rational numbers,\n        we know that  .\n        We now know that   and\n          are rational numbers and since the rational numbers are closed under \n        multiplication,\n        we conclude that\n         .\n       \n        However,   and hence,\n          must be a rational number.\n        Since a real number cannot be both rational and irrational,\n        this is a contradiction to the assumption that   is irrational.\n        We have therefore proved that for all real numbers   and  ,\n        if   is rational and   and   is irrational,\n        then   is irrational. \n       The Square Root of 2 Is an Irrational Number \n      The proof that the square root of 2 is an irrational number is one of the classic proofs in \n      mathematics,\n      and every mathematics student should know this proof.\n      This is why we will be doing some preliminary work with rational numbers and integers \n      before completing the proof.\n      The theorem we will be proving can be stated as follows:\n     \n          If   is a real number such that  ,\n          then   is an irrational number.\n         \n      This is stated in the form of a conditional statement,\n      but it basically means that   is irrational\n      (and that   is irrational).\n      That is,   cannot be written as a quotient of integers with the denominator \n      not equal to zero.\n     \n      In order to complete this proof,\n      we need to be able to work with some basic facts that follow about rational numbers and even \n      integers.\n       \n           \n            Each integer   is a rational number since   can be written as \n             .\n           \n         \n           \n            Notice that  , since\n             \n\n              We can also show that\n\n             \n           \n           \n           \n        was included to illustrate the fact that a rational number can \n      be written as a fraction in\n       lowest terms \n      with a positive denominator.\n      This means that any rational number can be written as a quotient  ,\n      where   and   are integers,  ,\n      and   and   have no common factor greater than 1.\n           \n\n             \n              If   is an integer and   is even,\n              what can be concluded about  .\n              Refer to  .\n             \n           \n     \n      In a proof by contradiction of a conditional statement  ,\n      we assume the negation of this statement or  .\n      So in a proof by contradiction of  ,\n      we will assume that   is a real number,\n       , and   is not irrational\n      (that is,   is rational).\n     \n          If   is a real number such that  ,\n          then   is an irrational number.\n         \n        We will use a proof by contradiction.\n        So we assume that the statement of the theorem is false.\n        That is, we assume that\n          is a real number,  , and   is a rational number.\n         \n       \n        Since   is a rational number,\n        there exist integers   and   with   such that\n         \n        and   and   have no common factor greater than 1.\n        We will obtain a contradiction by showing that   and   must both be even.\n        Squaring both sides of the last equation and using the fact that  ,\n        we obtain\n         \n       \n        Equation   implies that   is even,\n        and hence,\n        by  ,\n          must be an even integer.\n        This means that there exists an integer   such that  .\n        We can now substitute this into equation  , which gives\n         \n       \n        We can divide both sides of equation   by 2 to obtain  .\n        Consequently,\n          is even and we can once again use  \n        to conclude that   is an even integer.\n       \n        We have now established that both   and   are even.\n        This means that 2 is a common factor of   and  ,\n        which contradicts the assumption that   and   have no common factor greater than 1.\n        Consequently, the statement of the theorem cannot be false,\n        and we have proved that if   is a real number such that  ,\n        then   is an irrational number. \n       \n            This exercise is intended to provide another rationale as to why a proof by contradiction works.\n            Suppose that we are trying to prove that a statement   is true.\n            Instead of proving this statement,\n            assume that we prove that the conditional statement\n             If  , then  \n            is true, where   is some contradiction.\n            Recall that a contradiction is a statement that is always false.\n           \n                In symbols, write a statement that is a disjunction and that is logically \n                equivalent to  .\n               \n                   \n                 \n                Since we have proven that   is true,\n                then the disjunction in   must also be true.\n                Use this to explain why the statement   must be true.\n               \n                Now explain why   must be true if we prove that the negation of   \n                implies a contradiction.\n               \n            Are the following statements true or false?\n            Justify each conclusion.\n           \n                For all integers   and  ,\n

   This is a contradiction to the assumption that  .\n                  Therefore, the proposition is not false,\n                  and we have proven that for all real numbers   and  ,\n

So we assume that the statement is false.\n                  That is, we assume that there exist integers  ,\n                   ,\n                  and   such that 3  divides both     and   ,\n                  that   ,  and that  the equation\n                   \n                  has a solution in which both     and     are integers.\n                  So there exist integers     and     such that\n                   .\n                 \n                Now use the facts that  3  divides   , 3  divides   ,\n                and  .\n               Exploring a Quadratic Equation \n            Consider the following proposition:\n             Proposition \n                For all integers   and  ,\n                  if   is odd, then the equation\n                   \n                  has no integer solution for  .\n               \n           \n            What are the solutions of the equation when   and  ?\n            That is, what are the solutions of the equation  ?\n           \n            What are the solutions of the equation when   and  ?\n            That is, what are the solutions of the equation  ?\n           \n            Solve the resulting quadratic equation for at least two more examples using values of \n              and   that satisfy the hypothesis of the proposition.\n           \n            For this proposition,\n            why does it seem reasonable to try a proof by contradiction?\n           \n            For this proposition,\n            state clearly the assumptions that need to be made at the beginning of a proof \n            by contradiction.\n           \n            Use a proof by contradiction to prove this proposition.\n           "

 Beginning Activity 1 \n        was meant to introduce the idea of using cases in a proof.\n        The method of using cases is often used when the hypothesis of the proposition is a disjunction.\n        This is justified by the logical equivalency\n         .\n        See  \n        and  .\n        \n        In some other situations when we are trying to prove a proposition or a theorem about an \n        element   in some set  ,\n        we often run into the problem that there does not seem to be enough information about \n          to proceed.\n        For example, consider the following proposition:\n\n         Proposition 1 \n            If   is an integer,\n            then   is an even integer.\n           \n\n        If we were trying to write a direct proof of this proposition,\n        the only thing we could assume is that   is an integer.\n        This is not much help.\n        In a situation such as this,\n        we will sometimes use cases to provide additional assumptions for the forward process of \n        the proof.\n        Cases are usually based on some common properties that the element   may or may not \n        possess.\n        The cases must be chosen so that they exhaust all possibilities for the object   in the \n        hypothesis of the original proposition.\n        For  ,\n        we know that an integer must be even or it must be odd.\n        We can thus use the following two cases for the integer  :\n         \n             \n              The integer   is an even integer;\n             \n           \n

  can be used to construct a proof of \n             .\n           Some Common Situations to Use Cases \n      When using cases in a proof,\n      the main rule is that the cases must be chosen so that they exhaust all possibilities for an \n      object   in the hypothesis of the original proposition.\n      Following are some common uses of cases in proofs.\n\n       \n           When the hypothesis is,   is an integer. \n           \n            Case 1:   is an even integer.\n           \n           \n            Case 2:   is an odd integer.\n           \n         \n           When the hypothesis is,   and   are integers. \n           \n            Case 1:   and   are even.\n           \n           \n            Case 2:   is even and   is odd.\n           \n           \n            Case 3:   is odd and   is even.\n           \n           \n            Case 4:   and   are both odd. \n           \n         \n           When the hypothesis is,   is a real number. \n           \n

guidelines.\n      In addition,\n      we make sure that it is clear where each case begins.\n      This can be done by using a new paragraph with a label such as\n       Case 1, \n      or it can be done by starting a paragraph with a phrase such as,\n       In the case where  . \n     Using Cases:   Is Even or   Is Odd \n        Complete the proof of the following proposition:\n       \n        Proposition: For each integer  ,\n          is an odd integer.\n       \n        Proof: Let   be an integer.\n        We will prove that   is an odd integer by examining the case where \n          is even and the case where   is odd.\n       \n        Case 1: The integer   is even.\n        In this case,\n        there exists an integer   such that  .\n        Therefore,   .\n       \n          Proposition: For each integer  ,\n            is an odd integer.\n         \n          Let   be an integer.\n          We will prove that   is an odd integer by examining the case where   is even and the case where   is odd.\n         \n          In the case where   is even,\n          there exists an integer   such that  .\n          So in this case,\n           .\n         \n          Since   is an integer,\n          the last equation shows that if   is even,\n          then   is odd.\n         \n          In the case where   is odd,\n          there exists an integer   such that  .\n          So in this case,\n           .\n         \n          Since   is an integer,\n          the last equation shows that if   is odd,\n          then   is odd.\n          Hence, by using these two cases,\n          we have shown that for each integer  ,\n            is an odd integer.\n         \n      As another example of using cases,\n      consider a situation where we know that   and   are real numbers and  .\n      If we want to make a conclusion about  ,\n      the temptation might be to divide both sides of the equation by  .\n      However, we can only do this if  .\n      So, we consider two cases:\n      one when   and the other when  .\n     \n          For all real numbers   and  ,\n          if  , then   or  .\n         \n        We let   and   be real numbers and assume that  .\n        We will prove that   or   by considering two cases: (1)  ,\n        and (2)  .\n       \n        In the case where  ,\n        the conclusion of the proposition is true and so there is nothing to prove.\n       \n        In the case where  ,\n        we can multiply both sides of the equation   by   and obtain\n         .\n\n        So in both cases,   or  ,\n        and this proves that for all real numbers   and  ,\n        if  , then   or  . \n       Absolute Value \n      Most students by now have studied the concept of the absolute value of a real number.\n      We use the notation   to stand for the absolute value of the real number \n       .\n      One way to think of the absolute value of   is as the\n       distance \n      between   and 0 on the number line.\n      For example,\n       .\n     \n      Although this notion of absolute value is convenient for determining the absolute value of a \n      specific number,\n      if we want to prove properties about absolute value,\n      we need a more careful and precise definition.\n     Definition absolute value absolute value of x \n      Let's first see if this definition is consistent with our intuitive notion of absolute value by \n      looking at two specific examples.\n       \n           \n            Since  , we see that  ,\n            which should be no surprise.\n           \n

when   and the other for when  .\n      This means that when attempting to prove something about absolute value,\n      we often uses cases.\n      This will be illustrated in  .\n     \n          Let

prove that if  ,\n        then   or  .\n        So we assume that  .\n        In the case where  ,\n        we see that  ,\n        and since  ,\n        we can conclude that  .\n       \n        In the case where  ,\n        we see that  .\n        Since  ,\n        we can conclude that   and hence that  .\n        These two cases prove that if  ,\n        then   or  .\n       \n        We will now prove that if   or  ,\n        then  .\n        We start by assuming that   or  .\n        Since the hypothesis of this conditional statement is a disjunction,\n        we use two cases.\n        When  , we see that\n         .\n\n        When  , we conclude that\n         ,\n        and hence,  .\n        This proves that if   or  ,\n        then  .\n        Because we have proven both conditional statements,\n        we have proven that   if and only if   or \n         . \n        \n       \n          What is   and what is  ?\n         \n            and  \n         \n          Use the properties of absolute value in  \n          to help solve the following equations for  ,\n          where   is a real number.\n         \n               .\n             \n                  or  .\n               \n               .\n             \n                  or  .\n                So   or  .\n               \n               .\n             \n                  or  .\n                So

to have anything to do \n      with writing proofs,\n      the point of  \n      is to emphasize the importance of using cases when dealing with absolute value.\n      The following theorem provides some important properties of absolute value.\n     Triangle Inequality \n        We will prove  .\n        The proof of   is included in  ,\n        and the proof of   is  .\n        For  ,\n        we will prove the biconditional proposition by proving the two associated conditional \n        propositions.\n       \n        So we let   be a positive real number and let\n          and first assume that  .\n        We will use two cases: either   or  .\n         \n             \n              In the case where  ,\n              we know that   and so the inequality\n                implies that  .\n              However, we also know that\n                and that  .\n              Therefore, we conclude that   and,\n              hence,  .\n             \n           \n             \n              When  , we see that  .\n              Therefore, the inequality   implies that  ,\n              which in turn implies that  .\n              In this case,\n              we also know that   since   is negative and   is positive.\n              Hence,  .\n             \n           \n       \n        So in both cases, we have proven that\n          and this proves that if  ,\n        then  .\n        We now assume that  .\n         \n             \n              If  , then   and hence,\n               .\n             \n           \n             \n              If  ,\n              then   and so  .\n              Thus,  .\n              By multiplying both sides of the last inequality by  ,\n              we conclude that  .\n             \n           \n       \n        These two cases prove that if  ,\n        then  .\n        Hence, we have proven that\n          if and only if  . \n       consecutive integers integers consecutive consecutive integers \n          Use the fact that  .\n         \n          Prove that if   is an odd integer,\n          then the equation   has no solution that is an integer.\n         \n          Do not use the quadratic formula. Try a proof by contradiction. If there exists a \n          solution of the equation   that is an integer, then we can \n          conclude that there exists an integer   such that  . Then,\n           .\n          From  , we know that   is even and hence,   is even. \n          This contradicts the assumption that   is odd.\n         \n          Prove that if   is an odd integer,\n          then   for some integer   or\n            for some integer  .\n         \n          If   is an odd integer, then there exists an integer   such that \n           .  Use two cases: (1)   is even; (2)   is odd. \n          If   is even, then there exists an integer   such that   \n          and this means that   or  . If   is odd, \n          then there exists an integer   such that  . Then \n            or  .\n         \n          Prove the following proposition:\n           \n            For each integer  , if  , then   or  .\n           \n         \n          If   and  , then  . Since the product \n          is equal to zero, at least one of the factors must be zero. In the first case, \n           .  In the second case,\n            or  .\n         \n          Complete the following.\n         \n              Prove the following proposition:\n               \n                For all integers  ,  , and   with  , if \n                  divides   or   divides  , then   divides \n                the product  .\n               \n             \n                Notice that the hypothesis is a disjunction.

Division Algorithm using cases \n      The Division Algorithm  can sometimes be used to construct cases that can be used to prove a \n      statement that is true for all integers.\n      We have done this when we divided the integers into the even integers and the odd integers \n      since even integers have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2 and odd integers have a remainder \n      of 1 when divided by 2.\n     \n      Sometimes it is more useful to divide the integer   by an integer other than 2.\n      For example,\n      if   is divided by 3, there are three possible remainders: 0, 1, and 2.\n      If   is divided by 4, there are four possible remainders: 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n      The remainders form the basis for the cases.\n     \n      If the hypothesis of a proposition is that\n        is an integer, \n      then we can use the Division Algorithm to claim that there are unique integers   and \n        such that\n       .\n     \n      We can then divide the proof into the following three cases: (1)  ; (2)  ;\n      and (3)  .\n      This is done in  .\n     \n          If   is an integer, then 3 divides  .\n         \n        Let   be an integer.\n        We will show that 3 divides   by examining the three cases for the remainder \n        when   is divided by 3.\n        By the Division Algorithm,\n        there exist unique integers   and   such that\n         .\n       \n        This means that we can consider the following three cases: (1)  ; (2)  ;\n        and (3)  .\n       \n        In the case where  , we have  .\n        By substituting this into the expression  , we get\n\n         .\n\n       \n        Since   is an integer,\n        the last equation proves that  .\n       \n        In the second case,   and  .\n        When we substitute this into  ,\n        we obtain\n\n         .\n       \n        Since   is an integer,\n        the last equation proves that  .\n       \n        The last case is when  .\n        The details for this case are part of  .\n        Once this case is completed,\n        we will have proved that 3 divides   in all three cases.\n        Hence, we may conclude that if   is an integer,\n        then 3 divides  . \n       Properties of Congruence congruence \n          \n      Most of the work we have done so far has involved using definitions to help prove results.\n      We will continue to prove some results but we will now prove some theorems about congruence\n      ( \n      and  )\n      that we will then use to help prove other results.\n     \n      Let  .\n      Recall that if   and   are integers,\n      then we say that   is congruent to   modulo   provided that   \n      divides  ,\n      and we write  .\n      (See  .)\n\n      We are now going to prove some properties of congruence that are direct consequences of the \n      definition.\n      One of these properties was suggested by the work in \n       Beginning Activity 2 \n      and is   of the next theorem.\n     Properties of Congruence Modulo \n          Let   be a natural number and let   be integers.\n          If   and  , then\n           \n               \n                 .\n               \n

prove   and  .\n        The proof of   is  .\n        Let   be a natural number and let   be integers.\n        Assume that   and that  .\n        This means that   divides   and that   divides  .\n        Hence, there exist integers   and   such that   and  .\n        We can then write   and   and obtain\n\n         .\n\n       \n        By subtracting   from both sides of the last equation,\n        we see that\n         .\n       \n        Since   is an integer,\n        this proves that  ,\n        and hence we can conclude that  .\n        This completes the proof of  .\n       \n          basically means that if we have two congruences,\n        we can multiply the corresponding sides of these congruences to obtain another congruence.\n        We have assumed that   and so we write this twice as follows:\n         .\n\n        If we now use the result in   and multiply the corresponding \n        sides of these two congruences,\n        we obtain  .\n        We can then use this congruence and the congruence\n          and the result in   to conclude that\n         ,\n        or that  .\n        We can say that we can continue with this process to prove  ,\n        but this is not considered to be a formal proof of this result.\n        To construct a formal proof for this,\n        we could use a proof by mathematical induction.\n        This will be studied in  .\n        See   in  . \n       Proving   of  \n        Prove   of  .\n       \n          Let   be a natural number and let   be integers.\n          We assume that   and\n            and will prove that  .\n          Since   and  ,\n            divides   and   and so there exist integers \n            and   such that\n            and  .\n          We can then write   and   and obtain\n           \n         \n          By subtracting   from both sides of the last equation,\n          we see that\n           .\n         \n          Since   is an integer,\n          this proves that   divides  ,\n

stated and proved in  .\n      Please remember that textbook proofs are usually written in final form of\n       reporting the news. \n      Before reading these proofs,\n      it might be instructive to first try to construct a know-show table for each proof.\n     Properties of Congruence Modulo  reflexive property symmetric property \n        We will prove the reflexive property and the transitive property.\n        The proof of the symmetric property is  .\n       \n        Let  , and let  .\n        We will show that  .\n        Notice that\n         .\n       \n        This proves that   divides   and hence,\n        by the definition of congruence modulo  ,\n        we have proven that  .\n       \n        To prove the transitive property,\n        we let  ,\n        and let  ,  , and   be integers.\n        We assume that   and that  .\n        We will use the definition of congruence modulo   to prove that  .\n        Since   and  ,\n        we know that   and  .\n        Hence, there exist integers   and   such that\n\n         .\n\n        By adding the corresponding sides of these two equations,\n        we obtain\n         .\n\n        If we simplify the left side of the last equation and factor the right side, we get\n         .\n\n        By the closure property of the integers,\n         ,\n        and so this equation proves that\n          and hence that  .\n        This completes the proof of the transitive property of congruence modulo  . \n       Using Cases Based on Congruence Modulo  congruence Division Algorithm Division Algorithm congruence \n      Notice that the set of all integers that are congruent to 2 modulo 7 is\n       .\n\n      If we divide any integer in this set by 7 and write the result according to the Division Algorithm,\n      we will get a remainder of 2.\n      For example,\n       \n\n      Is this a coincidence or is this always true?\n      Let's look at the general case.\n      For this, let   be a natural number and let  .\n      By the Division Algorithm,\n      there exist unique integers   and   such that\n       .\n     \n      By subtracting   from both sides of the equation  ,\n      we obtain\n       .\n     \n      But this implies that   and hence that  .\n      We have proven the following result.\n     \n          Let   and let  .\n          If   for some integers   and  ,\n          then  .\n         \n      This theorem says that an integer is congruent\n      (mod  )\n      to its remainder when it is divided by  .\n      Since this remainder is unique and since the only possible remainders for division by   are  ,\n      we can state the following result.\n     \n          If  , then each integer is congruent,\n          modulo  ,\n          to precisely one of the integers  .\n          That is, for each integer  ,\n          there exists a unique integer   such that\n           .\n         \n       \n      can be used to set up cases for an integer in a proof.\n      If   and  ,\n      then we can consider   cases for  .\n      The integer   could be congruent to   modulo  .\n      For example,\n      if we assume that 5 does not divide an integer  ,\n      then we know   is not congruent to 0 modulo 5, and hence,\n      that   must be congruent to 1, 2, 3, or 4 modulo 5.\n      We can use these as 4 cases within a proof.\n      For example,\n      suppose we wish to determine the values of   modulo 5 for integers that are not congruent to 0 modulo 5.\n      We begin by squaring some integers that are not congruent to 0 modulo 5.\n      We see that\n       .\n     \n      These explorations indicate that the following proposition is true and we will now \n      outline a method to prove it.\n     \n          For each integer  , if  ,\n          then   or  .\n         \n          We will prove this proposition using cases for   based on congruence modulo 5.\n          In doing so,\n          we will use the results in  \n          and  .\n          Because the hypothesis is  ,\n          we can use four cases,\n          which are: (1)  , (2)\n           , (3)  ,\n          and (4)  .\n          Following are proofs for the first and fourth cases.\n         \n          Case 1.\n           .\n          In this case,\n          we use   to conclude that\n           .\n          This proves that if  ,\n          then  .\n         \n          Case 4.\n           .\n          In this case,\n          we use   to conclude that\n           .\n         \n          We also know that  .\n          So we have   and  ,\n          and we can now use the transitive property of congruence\n          ( )\n          to conclude that  .\n          This proves that if  ,\n          then  . \n         Using Properties of Congruence \n        Complete a proof of  \n        by completing proofs for the other two cases.\n       \n        Note: It is possible to prove  \n        using only the definition of congruence instead of using the properties that we have \n        proved about congruence.\n        However, such a proof would involve a good deal of algebra.\n        One of the advantages of using the properties is that it avoids the use of \n        complicated algebra in which it is easy to make mistakes.\n       \n        Case 2.\n         .\n        In this case,\n        we use   to conclude that\n         .\n       \n        This proves that if  ,\n        then  .\n       \n        Case 3.\n         .\n        In this case,\n        we use   to conclude that\n         .\n       \n        We also know that  .\n        So we have   and  ,\n        and we can now use the transitive property of congruence\n        ( )\n        to conclude that  .\n        This proves that if  ,\n        then  .\n       \n      In the proof of  ,\n      we used four cases.\n      Sometimes it may seem a bit overwhelming when confronted with a proof that requires several cases.\n      For example,\n      if we want to prove something about some integers modulo 6, we may have to use six cases.\n      However, there are sometimes additional assumptions\n      (or conclusions)\n      that can help reduce the number of cases that must be considered.\n      This will be illustrated in the next progress check.\n     Using Cases Modulo 6 \n        Suppose we want to determine the possible values for   modulo 6 for odd integers \n        that are not multiples of 3.\n        Before beginning to use congruence arithmetic\n        (as in the proof of  )\n        in each of the possible six cases,\n        we can show that some of the cases are not possible under these assumptions.\n        (In some sense,\n        we use a short proof by contradiction for these cases.)\n        So assume that   is an odd integer.\n        Then:\n         \n             \n              If  ,\n              then there exists an integer   such that  .\n              But then   and hence,   is even.\n              Since we assumed that   is odd,\n              this case is not possible.\n             \n           \n             \n              If  ,\n              then there exists an integer   such that  .\n              But then   and hence,   is even.\n              Since we assumed that   is odd,\n              this case is not possible.\n             \n           \n       \n            Prove that if   is an odd integer,\n            then   cannot be congruent to 4 modulo 6.\n           \n            Prove that if   is an integer and 3 does not divide  ,\n            then   cannot be congruent to 3 modulo 6.\n           \n            So if   is an odd integer that is not a multiple of 3, then   must be \n            congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6.\n            Use these two cases to prove the following proposition:\n             \n                  For each integer  ,\n                  if   is an odd integer that is not multiple of 3, then \n                   .\n                 \n           \n          Complete the details for the proof of Case 3 of  .\n         \n          Complete the following.\n         \n              Use cases based on congruence modulo 3 and properties of congruence to prove that \n              for each integer  ,\n               .\n             \n                The first case is when  .\n                We can then use  \n                to conclude that   or that  .\n                So in this case,  .\n               \n                For the second case,  .\n                We can then use  \n                to conclude that   or that  .\n                So in this case,  .\n               \n                The last case is when  .\n                We then get   or  .\n                Since  ,\n                we can use the transitive property to conclude that  ,\n                and so  .\n                Since we have proved it in all three cases,\n                we conclude that for each integer  ,  .\n               \n              Explain why the result in   proves that for each integer  , \n              3 divides  .\n              Compare this to the proof of the same result in  .\n             \n                Since  ,\n                we use the definition of congruence to conclude that 3 divides \n                 .\n               \n          Prove the symmetric property of congruence stated in  .\n         \n          For   , you need to prove that if\n           ,  then   .  So let  \n            and assume that\n           .  So   and there exists an \n          integer   such that\n           .  Then,   and  .\n         \n          Consider the following proposition: For each integer  ,\n          if 3 divides  , then 3 divides  .\n         \n              Write the contrapositive of this proposition.\n             \n                The contrapositive is: For each integer  ,\n                if 3 does not divide  ,\n                then 3 divides  .\n               \n              Prove the proposition by proving its contrapositive. \n             \n              Consider using cases \n              based on the Division Algorithm using the remainder for\n               division by 3. \n              There will be two cases.\n             \n                To prove the contrapositive,\n                let   and assume that 3 does not divide  .\n                So using the Division Algorithm,\n                we can consider two cases: (1) There exists a unique integer   such that\n                 . (2) There exists a unique integer   such that \n                 .\n                For the first case,\n                show that  .\n                For the second case,\n                show that  .\n                Since the Division Algorithm states that the remainder is unique,\n                this shows that in both cases,\n                the remainder is 1 and so 3 does not divide  .\n               \n          Complete the following.\n         \n              Let   and let  .\n              Explain why   divides   if and only if  .\n             \n                  if and only if  .\n               \n              Let  .\n              Explain why if  ,\n              then   or  .\n             \n                Let  .\n                 \n                tell us that if  ,\n                then   or  .\n               \n              Is the following proposition true or false?\n              Justify your conclusion.\n               \n                For each  , if  , then \n                 .\n               \n             \n                  tells us we can use a proof by cases using the \n                following two cases: (1)\n                 ; (2)  .\n                So, if  ,\n                then by  ,\n                 , and hence,\n                 .\n                If  ,\n                then by  ,\n                 , and hence,\n                 .\n                Since  ,\n                this implies that  .\n               \n          Prove the following proposition by proving its contrapositive. \n           \n            For all integers   and  , if  , then   or  .\n           \n         \n          Use case analysis.\n          There are several cases.\n         \n          The contrapositive is:  Let   and   be integers. \n          If   and\n           , then  .\n          Using  , we can use the following four cases:\n           \n               \n                  and  ;\n               \n             \n               \n                  and  ;\n               \n             \n               \n                  and  ;\n               \n             \n               \n                  and  .\n               \n             \n\n          In all four cases, we use   to conclude that\n           .

\n           \n            \n            This type of proof is often used when both the hypothesis and the conclusion \n            are stated in the form of negations.\n            This often works well if the conclusion contains the operator\n             or ; that is, if the conclusion is in the form of a disjunction.\n            In this case, the negation will be a conjunction.\n           \n         \n           Description of the process \n           \n            \n            We prove the logically equivalent statement  .\n            The forward-backward method is used to prove  .\n            That is, we work forward from\n              and backward from  .\n           \n         \n           Why the process makes sense \n           \n            \n            When we prove  ,\n            we are also proving   because these two statements are \n            logically equivalent.\n            When we prove the contrapositive of  ,\n            we are doing a direct proof of  .\n            So we assume   because,\n            when doing a direct proof, we assume the hypothesis,\n            and   is the hypothesis of the contrapositive.\n            We must show   because it is the conclusion of the contrapositive.\n           \n         \n     Proof of   Using a Proof by Contradiction contradiction proof by contradiction \n       \n           When is it indicated? \n           \n            \n            This type of proof is often used when the conclusion is stated in the form of a \n            negation,\n            but the hypothesis is not.\n            This often works well if the conclusion contains the operator\n             or ; that is, if the conclusion is in the form of a disjunction.\n            In this case, the negation will be a conjunction.\n           \n         \n           Description of the process \n           \n            \n            Assume   and   and work forward from these two assumptions \n            until a contradiction is obtained.\n           \n         \n           Why the process makes sense \n           \n            \n            The statement   is either true or false.\n            In a proof by contradiction,\n            we show that it is true by eliminating the only other possibility\n            (that it is false).\n            We show that   cannot be false by assuming it is false and reaching a \n            contradiction.\n            Since we assume that   is false,\n            and the only way for a conditional statement to be false is for its hypothesis to \n            be true and its conclusion to be false,\n            we assume that   is true and that   is false\n            (or, equivalently, that   is true).\n            When we reach a contradiction,\n            we know that our original assumption that   is false is incorrect.\n            Hence,   cannot be false, and so it must be true.\n           \n         \n     Other Methods of Proof \n        The methods of proof that were just described are three of the most common types of proof.\n        However, we have seen other methods of proof and these are described below.\n       Proofs that Use a Logical Equivalency \n        As was indicated in  ,\n        we can sometimes use a logical equivalency to help prove a statement.\n        For example, in order to prove a statement of the form\n         ,\n        it is sometimes possible to use the logical equivalency\n         .\n \n        We would then prove the statement\n         .\n\n        Most often, this would use a direct proof for statement   but \n        other methods could also be used.\n        Because of the logical equivalency,\n        by proving statement  ,\n        we have also proven the statement  .\n       Proofs that Use Cases cases, proof using proof using cases \n            \n        When we are trying to prove a proposition or a theorem,\n        we often run into the problem that there does not seem to be enough information to proceed.\n        In this situation,\n        we will sometimes use cases to provide additional assumptions for the forward \n        process of the proof.\n        When this is done,\n        the original proposition is divided into a number of separate cases that are proven \n        independently of each other.\n        The cases must be chosen so that they exhaust all possibilities for the hypothesis \n        of the original proposition.\n        This method of case analysis is justified by the logical equivalency\n         ,\n        which was established in  Beginning Activity 1 \n        in  .\n       Constructive Proof constructive proof proof constructive existence theorem.

  "body": "The Principle of Mathematical Induction Beginning Activity 1: Exploring Statements of the Form \n       \n        One of the most fundamental sets in mathematics is the set of natural numbers  .\n        In this section, we will learn a new proof technique,\n        called mathematical induction,\n        that is often used to prove statements of the form \n         .\n        In  ,\n        we will learn how to extend this method to statements of the form \n         ,\n        where   is a certain type of subset of the integers  .\n       \n        For each natural number  ,\n        let   be the following open sentence:\n         .\n       \n              Does this open sentence become a true statement when  ?\n              That is, is 1 in the truth set of  ?\n             \n              Does this open sentence become a true statement when  ?\n              That is, is 2 in the truth set of  ?\n             \n              Choose at least four more natural numbers and determine whether the open sentence is true or false for each of your choices.\n             \n        All of the examples that were used should provide evidence that the following \n        proposition is true: \n         .\n        We should keep in mind that no matter how many examples we try,\n        we cannot prove this proposition with a list of examples because we can never check \n        if 4 divides\n          for every natural number  .\n        Mathematical induction will provide a method for proving this proposition.\n       \n        For another example, for each natural number  ,\n        we now let   be the following open sentence:\n         .\n       \n        The expression on the left side of the previous equation is the sum of the squares \n        of the first   natural numbers.\n        So when  ,\n        the left side of equation   is  .\n        When  ,\n        the left side of equation   is  .\n       \n              Does   become a true statement when\n             \n                     ?

(Is 3 in the truth set of  ?)\n                   \n              Choose at least four more natural numbers and determine whether the open sentence is true or false for each of your choices.\n

following proposition is true: \n         \n          For each natural number  ,\n           .\n         \n        In this section,\n        we will learn how to use mathematical induction to prove this statement.\n       Beginning Activity 2: A Property of the Natural Numbers \n        Intuitively,\n        the natural numbers begin with the number 1, and then there is 2, then 3, then 4, \n        and so on.\n        Does this process of\n         starting with 1 \n        and\n         adding 1 repeatedly \n        result in all the natural numbers?\n        We will use the concept of an inductive set to explore this idea in this activity.\n       Definition inductive set inductive set \n            Carefully explain what it means to say that a subset   of the integers   is not an inductive set.\n            This description should use an existential quantifier.\n           \n            Use the definition of an inductive set to determine which of the following sets are inductive sets and which are not.\n            Do not worry about formal proofs,\n            but if a set is not inductive,\n            be sure to provide a specific counterexample that proves it is not inductive.\n           \n                   \n                 \n                  The set of natural numbers,  \n                 \n                   \n                 \n                   \n

This part will explore one of the underlying mathematical ideas for a proof by \n            induction.\n            Assume that   and assume that   and \n            that   is an inductive set.\n            Use the definition of an inductive set to answer each of the following:\n           \n                  Is  ?\n                  Explain.\n                 \n                  Is  ?\n                  Explain.\n                 \n                  Is  ?\n                  Explain.\n                 \n                  Is  ?\n                  Explain.\n                 \n                  Do you think that  ?\n                  Explain.\n                 Inductive Sets \n      The two open sentences in  Beginning Activity 1 \n      appeared to be true for all values of   in the set of natural numbers,\n       .\n      That is, the examples in this beginning activity provided evidence that the following \n      two statements are true.\n       \n           \n            For each natural number  , 4 divides  .\n           \n         \n           \n            For each natural number  ,\n             .\n           \n         \n  \n      One way of proving statements of this form uses the concept of an inductive set \n      introduced in  Beginning Activity 2 .\n      The idea is to prove that if one natural number makes the open sentence true,\n      then the next one also makes the open sentence true.\n      This is how we handle the phrase\n       and so on \n      when dealing with the natural numbers.\n      In  Beginning Activity 2 ,\n      we saw that the number systems   and   and other sets are inductive.\n      What we are trying to do is somehow distinguish   from the other inductive sets.\n      The way to do this was suggested in   of \n       Beginning Activity 2 .\n      Although we will not prove it,\n      the following statement should seem true.\n       Statement 1 \n          For each subset   of  ,\n          if   and   is inductive,\n          then  .\n         \n      Notice that the integers,  ,\n      and the set   \n      both contain 1 and both are inductive,\n      but they both contain numbers other than natural numbers.\n      For example, the following statement is false:\n     Statement 2 \n        \n          For each subset   of  ,\n          if   and   is inductive,\n          then  .\n        \n       \n      The set   \n      is a counterexample that shows that this statement is false.\n     Inductive Sets \n        Suppose that   is an inductive subset of the integers.\n        Which of the following statements are true,\n        which are false, and for which ones is it not possible to tell?\n       \n                and  .\n             \n                It is not possible to tell if   and  .\n               \n              If  , then  .\n             \n                True.\n               \n              If  , then  .\n             \n                True.\n                The contrapositive is,\n                 If  , then  , \n                which is true.\n               \n              For each integer  , if  , then  .\n             \n                True.\n               \n              For each integer  ,\n                or  .\n             \n                True, since\n                  or  \n                is logically equivalent to\n                 If  , then  . \n               \n              There exists an integer   such that   and  .\n             \n                False.\n                If  , then  .\n               \n              For each integer  , if\n               , then  .\n             \n                It is not possible to tell if this is true.\n                It is the converse of the conditional statement,\n                 For each integer  ,\n                if  , then  . \n               \n              For each integer  , if\n               , then  .\n             \n                True.\n                This is the contrapositive of the conditional statement,\n                 For each integer  ,\n                if  , then  . \n               The Principle of Mathematical Induction \n      Although we proved that  Statement 2  is false, in this text,\n      we will not prove that  Statement 1  is true.\n      One reason for this is that we really do not have a formal definition of the natural numbers.\n      However, we should be convinced that  Statement 1  is true.\n      We resolve this by making  Statement 1  an axiom for the natural \n      numbers so that this becomes one of the defining characteristics of the natural numbers.\n\n       The Principle of Mathematical Induction Principle of Mathematical Induction mathematical induction Principle \n            If   is a subset of   such that\n             \n                 \n                   , and\n                 \n               \n                 \n                  For every  ,\n                  if  , then  ,\n                 \n               \n            then  .\n           \n     Using the Principle of Mathematical Induction mathematical induction basis step basis step mathematical induction inductive step inductive step basis step initial step inductive step inductive assumption inductive hypothesis. \n      The key to constructing a proof by induction is to discover how\n        is related to   for an arbitrary natural number  .\n      For example,\n      in  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n      one of the open sentences   was\n       .\n\n      Sometimes it helps to look at some specific examples such as   and  .\n      The idea is not just to do the computations,\n      but to see how the statements are related.\n      This can sometimes be done by writing the details instead of immediately doing computations.\n       .\n \n      In this case, the key is the left side of each equation.\n      The left side of   is obtained from the left side of   by \n      adding one term,\n      which is  .\n      This suggests that we might be able to obtain the equation for   by adding \n        to both sides of the equation in  .\n      Now for the general case, if  ,\n      we look at   and compare it to  .\n       \n\n      The key is to look at the left side of the equation for\n        and realize what this notation means.\n      It means that we are adding the squares of the first   \n      natural numbers.\n      This means that we can write\n       .\n     \n      This shows us that the left side of the equation for\n        can be obtained from the left side of the equation for   by adding  .\n      This is the motivation for proving the inductive step in the following proof.\n     \n          For each natural number  ,\n           .\n         \n        We will use a proof by mathematical induction.\n        For each natural number  , we let   be\n         .\n       \n        We first prove that   is true.\n        Notice that  .\n        This shows that\n         ,\n        which proves that   is true.\n       \n        For the inductive step, we prove that for each  ,\n        if   is true, then   is true.\n        So let   be a natural number and assume that   is true.\n        That is, assume that\n         .\n       \n        The goal now is to prove that   is true.\n        That is, it must be proved that\n         .\n       \n        To do this, we add   to both sides of \n        equation   and algebraically rewrite the right \n        side of the resulting equation.\n        This gives\n         .\n\n        Comparing this result to equation  ,\n        we see that if   is true,\n        then   is true.\n        Hence, the inductive step has been established,\n        and by the  ,\n        we have proved that for each natural number  ,\n         . \n       Writing Guideline writing guidelines \n          \n      The proof of   shows a standard way to write an \n      induction proof.\n      When writing a proof by mathematical induction,\n      we should follow the guideline that we always keep the reader informed.\n      This means that at the beginning of the proof,\n      we should state that a proof by induction will be used.\n      We should then clearly define the open sentence   that will be used in \n      the proof.\n     Summation Notation \n      The result in  \n      could be written using summation notation as follows: \n       \n        For each natural number  ,\n         .\n       \n \n      In this case, we use   for the index for the summation,\n      and the notation   tells us to add all the values of \n        for   from 1 to  ,\n      inclusive.\n      That is,\n       .\n     \n      So in the proof of  ,\n      we would let   be \n       ,\n      and we would use the fact that for each natural number  ,\n       .\n     An Example of a Proof by Induction \n            Calculate   and\n              for several natural numbers  .\n            What do you observe?\n           \n            Use mathematical induction to prove that \n             .\n            To do this, let   be the open sentence,\n             . \n            For the basis step, notice that the equation\n              shows that   is true.\n            Now let   be a natural number and assume that   is true.\n            That is, assume that\n             ,\n            and complete the proof.\n           \n            Let   be the predicate,\n             . \n            For the basis step, notice that the equation\n              shows that   is true.\n            Now let   be a natural number and assume that   is true.\n            That is, assume that\n             .\n           \n            We now need to prove that   is true or that\n             .\n           \n            By adding   to both sides of equation  \n            we see that\n             \n           \n            By comparing the last equation to equation  \n            we see that we have proved that if   is true,\n            then

.\n           Some Comments about Mathematical Induction \n         \n          The basis step is an essential part of a proof by induction.\n          See   for an example that shows that the basis step is \n          needed in a proof by induction.\n         \n       \n         \n            provides an example that shows the inductive \n          step is also an essential part of a proof by mathematical induction.\n         \n       \n         \n          It is important to remember that the inductive step in an induction proof is a \n          proof of a conditional statement.\n          Although we did not explicitly use the forward-backward process in the inductive \n          step for  ,\n          it was implicitly used in the discussion prior to  .\n          The key question was,\n           How does knowing the sum of the first   squares help us find the sum of \n          the first   squares? \n         \n       \n         \n          When proving the inductive step in a proof by induction,\n          the key question is, \n           \n            How does knowing    help us prove   ?\n           \n          In  ,\n          we were able to see that the way to answer this question was to add a certain \n          expression to both sides of the equation given in   .\n          Sometimes the relationship between     and\n            is not as easy to see.\n          For example,\n          in  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n          we explored the following proposition: \n           \n            For each natural number  ,  4  divides   .\n           \n          This means that the open sentence,  , is\n           4  divides   . \n          So in the inductive step,\n          we assume    and that  4  divides   .\n          This means that there exists an integer     such that\n           .\n          In the backward process,\n          the goal is to prove that 4 divides  .\n          This can be accomplished if we can prove that there exists an integer   \n          such that\n           .\n          We now need to see if there is anything in equation   that \n          can be used in equation  .\n          The key is to find something in the equation\n            that is related to something similar in the equation \n           .\n          In this case, we notice that\n           .\n          So if we can solve    for   ,\n          we could make a substitution for  .\n          This is done in the proof of the following proposition.\n         \n       \n          For every natural number  , 4 divides  .\n         \n        (Proof by Mathematical Induction) For each natural number  ,\n        let   be\n         4 divides  . \n        We first prove that   is true.\n        Notice that when  ,\n         .\n        Since 4 divides 4,   is true.\n       \n        For the inductive step, we prove that for all  ,\n        if   is true,\n        then   is true.\n        So let   be a natural number and assume that   is true.\n        That is, assume that\n         .\n \n        This means that there exists an integer   such that\n         .\n \n        Thus,\n         .\n\n        In order to prove that   is true,\n        we must show that 4 divides  .\n        Since  , we can write\n         .\n \n        We now substitute the expression for   from equation  \n        into equation  .\n        This gives\n         \n       \n        Since   is an integer,\n        equation   shows that 4 divides  .\n        Therefore, if   is true,\n        then   is true and the inductive step has been established.\n        Thus, by the Principle of Mathematical Induction,\n        for every natural number  , 4 divides  . \n        \n       \n        was stated in terms of\n       divides. \n      We can use congruence to state a proposition that is equivalent to \n       .\n      The idea is that the sentence, 4 divides\n        means that  .\n      So the following proposition is equivalent to  .\n     \n          For every natural number  ,  .\n         \n      Since we have proved  ,\n      we have in effect proved  .\n      However, we could have proved  \n      first by using the results in  .\n      This will be done in the next progress check.\n     Proof of  \n        To prove  ,\n        we let   be   and notice that   is \n        true since  .\n        For the inductive step,\n        let   be a natural number and assume that   is true.\n        That is, assume that  .\n       \n              What must be proved in order to prove that   is true?\n             \n                To prove that   is true,\n                we must prove  .\n               \n              Since  ,\n              multiply both sides of the congruence   by 5.\n              The results in  \n              justify this step.\n             \n                Since  ,\n                we multiply both sides of the congruence   by 5 and obtain\n                 .\n               \n              Now complete the proof that for each\n               , if   is true,\n              then   is true and complete the induction proof of \n               .\n             \n                Since   and we know that  ,\n                we can use the transitive property of congruence to obtain  .\n                This proves that if   is true,\n                then   is true,\n                and hence, by the Principle of Mathematical Induction,\n                we have proved that for each natural number  ,  .\n               \n        It might be nice to compare the proofs of \n         \n        and  \n        and decide which one is easier to understand.\n       \n          Which of the following sets are inductive sets?\n          Explain.\n         \n               \n             \n                This

The empty set is inductive (why?).\n               \n          Use mathematical induction to prove each of the following:\n         \n              For each natural number  ,\n               .\n             \n                For each   , let    be,\n                 . \n                When we use  , the summation on the left side of the equation is 2, \n                and the right side is  .  Therefore, \n                   is true.   For the inductive step, let   \n                and assume that\n                  is true.  Then,\n                 .\n                We now add   to both sides of this equation. \n                This gives\n                 \n                If we now combine the terms on the right side of the equation into a single \n                fraction, we obtain\n                 \n                This proves that if    is true, then \n                  is true.\n               \n              For each natural number  ,\n               .\n             \n              For each natural number  ,\n               .\n             \n          Based on the results in  \n          and   from  , if  ,\n          is there any conclusion that can be made about the relationship between the sum\n            and the sum \n           ?\n         \n          Instead of using induction,\n          we can sometimes use previously proven results about a summation to obtain \n          results about a different summation.\n         \n              Use the result in  \n              to prove the

           \n               Proof \n               \n                We will prove this proposition using mathematical induction.\n                For each natural number  , we let   be\n               \n               \n                Any set of   dogs consists entirely of dogs of the same breed.\n               \n               \n                We will prove that for each natural number  ,\n                  is true, which will prove that all dogs are the same breed.\n                A set with only one dog consists entirely of dogs of the same breed and,\n                hence,   is true.\n               \n               \n                So we let   be a natural number and assume that   is true, that is,\n                that every set of   dogs consists of dogs of the same breed.\n                Now consider a set   of   dogs, where\n                 .\n               \n               \n                If we remove the dog   from the set  ,\n                we then have a set   of   dogs,\n                and using the assumption that   is true,\n                these dogs must all be of the same breed.\n                Similarly, if we remove   from the set  ,\n                we again have a set   of   dogs,\n                and these dogs must all be of the same breed.\n                Since  ,\n                we have proved that all of the dogs in   must be of the same breed.\n               \n               \n                This proves that if   is true,\n                then   is true and, hence,\n                by mathematical induction,\n                we have proved that for each natural number  ,\n                any set of   dogs consists entirely of dogs of the same breed.\n               \n             \n         The Importance of the Basis Step \n          Most of the work done in constructing a proof by induction is usually in proving the \n          inductive step.\n          This was certainly the case in  .\n          However, the basis step is an essential part of the proof.\n          Without it, the proof is incomplete.\n          To see this, let   be\n           .\n         \n          Let   .\n          Complete the following proof that if    is true,\n          then    is true.\n          Let   .\n          Assume that    is true.\n          That is, assume that\n           .\n          The goal is to prove that    is true.\n          That is, we need to prove that\n           .\n          To do this, we add    to both sides of \n          equation  .\n          This gives\n           .\n         \n          Is   true?\n          Is   true?\n          What about   and  ?\n          Explain how this shows that the basis step is an essential part of a proof by induction.\n         Regions of a Circle \n          Place   equally spaced points on a circle and connect each pair of points \n          with the chord of the circle determined by that pair of points.\n          See  .\n          \n           Regions of Circles \n              Four circles with points on their circumference, and with lines connecting the \n              points to divide each circle into regions. With 1 point there is 1 region, 2 points \n              make 2 regions, 3 points make 4 regions, 4 points make 8 regions.\n             \n\n          Count the number of distinct regions within each circle.\n          For example, with three points on the circle,\n          there are four distinct regions.\n          Organize your data in a table with two columns:\n           Number of Points on the Circle \n          and\n           Number of Distinct Regions in the Circle. \n         \n          How many regions are there when there are four equally spaced points on the circle?\n         \n          Based on the work so far,\n          make a conjecture about how many distinct regions would you get with five equally \n          spaced points.\n         \n          Based on the work so far,\n          make a conjecture about how many distinct regions would you get with six equally \n          spaced points.\n         \n           \n          shows the figures associated with   and  \n          Count the number of regions in each case.\n          Are your conjectures correct or incorrect?\n           Regions of Circles \n                a circle with five points on its circumference is divided into sixteen regions. \n                A circle with six points on its circumference is divided into thirty two regions.\n               \n         \n          Explain why this activity shows that the inductive step is an essential part of a \n          proof by mathematical induction.\n         "

to use induction to prove that any composite number can be written as a product of prime numbers?\n             The Domino Theory domino theory \n          \n      Mathematical induction is frequently used to prove statements of the form\n       ,\n      where   is an open sentence.\n      This means that we are proving that every statement in the following infinite list is true.\n       \n     \n      The inductive step in a proof by induction is to prove that if one statement in this \n      infinite list of statements is true,\n      then the next statement in the list must be true.\n      Now imagine that each statement in equation   is a domino in a chain \n      of dominoes.\n      When we prove the inductive step,\n      we are proving that if one domino is knocked over,\n      then it will knock over the next one in the chain.\n      Even if the dominoes are set up so that when one falls,\n      the next one will fall,\n      no dominoes will fall unless we start by knocking one over.\n      This is why we need the basis step in an induction proof.\n      The basis step guarantees that we knock over the first domino.\n      The inductive step, then,\n      guarantees that all dominoes after the first one will also fall.\n     Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction Using the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction \n      The primary use of the Principle of Mathematical Induction is to prove statements of the form\n       ,\n      where   is an integer and   is some open sentence.\n      (In most induction proofs,\n      we will use a value of   that is greater than or equal to zero.)\n      So our goal is to prove that the truth set   of the predicate   \n      contains all integers greater than or equal to  .\n      So to verify the hypothesis of the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction, we must\n       \n           \n            Prove that  .\n            That is, prove that   is true.\n           \n         \n           \n            Prove that for every   with  ,\n            if  , then  .\n            That is, prove that if   is true,\n            then   is true.\n           \n         \n     basis step initial step inductive step Using the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction \n        Let   be an integer.\n        To prove:  \n         \n             Basis step: \n             \n              Prove  .\n             \n           \n             Inductive step: \n             \n              Prove that for every   with  ,\n              if   is true, then   is true.\n             \n           \n       \n        We can then conclude that   is true for all\n          with  .\n       \n      This is basically the same procedure as the one for using the \n      Principle of Mathematical Induction.\n      The only difference is that the basis step uses an integer   other than 1.\n      For this reason,\n      when we write a proof that uses the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction,\n      we often simply say we are going to use a proof by mathematical induction.\n      We will use the work from  Beginning Activity 1  to \n      illustrate such a proof.\n     \n          For each natural number   with  ,\n           .\n         \n        We will use a proof by mathematical induction.\n        For this proof, we let   be\n         . \n        We first prove that   is true.\n        Using  , we see that   and  .\n        This means that   and, hence,\n          is true.\n       \n        For the inductive step, we prove that for all\n          with  ,\n        if   is true, then   is true.\n        So let   be a natural number greater than or equal to 4, and \n        assume that   is true.\n        That is, assume that\n         .\n       \n        The goal is to prove that   is true or that \n         .\n        Multiplying both sides of inequality   by   gives\n         \n       \n        Now,  .\n        Thus,  ,\n        and hence  .\n        This means that\n         .\n       \n        Inequalities   and   show that\n         ,\n        and this proves that if   is true,\n        then   is true.\n        Thus, the inductive step has been established,\n        and so by the

work in  Beginning Activity 2 .)\n     \n      Suppose we would like to use induction to prove that   is true for all \n      natural numbers greater than 1.\n      We have seen that the idea of the inductive step in a proof by induction is to prove \n      that if one statement in an infinite list of statements is true,\n      then the next statement must also be true.\n      The problem here is that when we factor a composite number,\n      we do not get to the previous case.\n      For example,\n      if assume that   is true and we want to prove that   is true,\n      we could factor 40 as  .\n      However, the assumption that   is true does not help us prove that \n        is true.\n     Second Principle of Mathematical Induction The Second Principle of Mathematical Induction Second

Also, suppose that newborn rabbits become adults \n        in two months and produce another pair of rabbits.  Starting with one adult pair of \n        rabbits, how many pairs of rabbits will be produced each month for one year?\n       \n     \n      Since we start with one adult pair,\n      there will be one pair produced the first month,\n      and since there is still only one adult pair,\n      one pair will also be produced in the second month\n      (since the new pair produced in the first month is not yet mature).\n      In the third month, two pairs will be produced,\n      one by the original pair and one by the pair which was produced in the first month.\n      In the fourth month, three pairs will be produced,\n      and in the fifth month, five pairs will be produced.\n     \n      The basic rule is that in a given month after the first two months,\n      the number of adult pairs is the number of adult pairs one month ago plus the number of \n      pairs born two months ago.\n      This is summarized in  ,\n      where the number of pairs produced is equal to the number of adult pairs,\n      and the number of adult pairs follows the Fibonacci sequence of numbers that we \n      developed in  Beginning Activity 2 .\n     Fibonacci Numbers Months 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Adult Pairs 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 Newborn Pairs 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 Month-Old Pairs 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 \n     Hemachandra, Acharya \n      Historically,\n      it is interesting to note that Indian mathematicians were studying these types of \n      numerical sequences well before Fibonacci.\n      In particular,\n      about fifty years before Fibonacci introduced his sequence, Acharya Hemachandra\n      (sometimes spelled Hemchandra)\n          \n      (1089   1173) considered the following problem,\n      which is from the biography of Hemachandra in the\n      \n       \n      MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive\n         .\n       \n        Suppose we assume that lines are composed of syllables which are either short or long. \n        Suppose also that each long syllable takes twice as long to articulate as a short syllable. \n        A line of length   contains   units where each short syllable is one \n        unit and each long syllable is two units. Clearly a line of length   units \n        takes the same time to articulate regardless of how it is composed. Hemchandra asks: \n        How many different combinations of short and long syllables are possible in a line of \n        length  ?\n       \n     \n      This is an important problem in the Sanskrit language since Sanskrit meters are based \n      on duration rather than on accent as in the English Language.\n      The answer to this question generates a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n      Suppose that   is the number of patterns of syllables of length  .\n      We then see that   and  .\n      Now let   be a natural number and consider pattern of length  .\n      This pattern either ends in a short syllable or a long syllable.\n      If it ends in a short syllable and this syllable is removed,\n      then there is a pattern of length  ,\n      and there are   such patterns.\n      Similarly, if it ends in a long syllable and this syllable is removed,\n      then there is a pattern of length  ,\n      and there are   such patterns.\n      From this, we conclude that\n       .\n\n      This actually generates the sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,  .\n      For more information about Hemachandra,\n      see the article  Math for Poets and Drummers \n      by Rachel Wells Hall in the February 2008 issue of  Math Horizons .\n     \n     Fibonacci Quarterly \n      We will continue to use the Fibonacci sequence in this book.\n      This sequence may not seem all that important or interesting.\n      However, it turns out that this sequence occurs in nature frequently and has applications \n      in computer science.\n      There is even a scholarly journal,\n       The Fibonacci Quarterly ,\n          \n      devoted to the Fibonacci numbers.\n     \n      The sequence of Fibonacci numbers is one of the most studied sequences in mathematics,\n      due mainly to the many beautiful patterns it contains.\n      Perhaps one observation you made in  Beginning Activity 2 \n      is that every third Fibonacci number is even.\n      This can be written as a proposition as follows:\n       .\n\n      As with many propositions associated with definitions by recursion,\n      we can prove this using mathematical induction.\n      The first step is to define the appropriate open sentence.\n      For this, we can let   be,\n        is an even natural number. \n     \n      Notice that   is true since  .\n      We now need to prove the inductive step.\n      To do this, we need to prove that for each  ,\n       \n        if   is true, then   is true.\n       \n      That is, we need to prove that for each  ,\n      if   is even, then   is even.\n     \n      So let's analyze this conditional statement using a know-show table.\n     Step Know Reason   is even.

introduced some basic definitions used in set theory,\n      what it means to say that two sets are equal and what it means to say that one set is a \n      subset of another set.\n      See  Definition .\n      We need one more definition.\n     Definition proper subset subset proper proper subset \n      One reason for the definition of proper subset is that each set is a subset of itself.\n      That is, If   is a set,\n      then  .\n      However, sometimes we need to indicate that a set   is a subset of   but \n       .\n      For example, if\n       ,\n      then  .\n      We know that   since each element of   is an element of  ,\n      but   since   and  .\n      (Also,   and  .)\n      Notice that the notations   and\n        are used in a manner similar to inequality notation for numbers\n      (  and  ).\n     \n      It is often very important to be able to describe precisely what it means to say that \n      one set is not a subset of the other.\n      In the preceding example,\n        is not a subset of   since there exists an element of   \n      (namely, 0) that is not in  .\n     \n      In general, the subset relation is described with the use of a universal quantifier since\n        means that for each element   of  ,\n      if  , then  .\n      So when we negate this, we use an existential quantifier as follows:\n\n     .\n    \n\n      So we see that   means that there exists an   in   \n      such that   and  .\n     \n      Notice that if  ,\n      then the conditional statement,\n       For each  , if\n       , then  \n      must be true since the hypothesis will always be false.\n      Another way to look at this is to consider the following statement:\n    \n      means that there exists an\n        such that  .\n     \n      However, this statement must be false since there does not exist an   in \n       .\n      Since this is false,\n      we must conclude that  .\n      Although the facts that   and\n        may not seem very important,\n      we will use these facts later,\n      and hence we summarize them in  .\n     \n          For any set  ,\n            and  .\n         \n      In  ,\n      we also defined two sets to be equal when they have precisely the same elements.\n      For example,\n       .\n     \n      If the two sets   and   are equal,\n      then it must be true that every element of   is an element of  ,\n      that is,  ,\n      and it must be true that every element of   is an element of  ,\n      that is,  .\n      Conversely, if   and  ,\n      then   and   must have precisely the same elements.\n      This gives us the following test for set equality:\n     \n          Let   and   be subsets of some universal set  .\n          Then   if and only if\n            and  .\n         Using Set Notation \n        Let the universal set be  , and let\n         .\n       \n        In each of the following,\n        fill in the blank with one or more of the symbols\n          so that the resulting \n        statement is true.\n        For each blank,\n        include all symbols that result in a true statement.\n        If none of these symbols makes a true statement,\n        write nothing in the blank.\n       \n             \n           \n             \n           \n          5 \n         \n             \n           \n           \n         \n

Diagrams \n      In  Beginning Activity 2 ,\n      we learned how to use Venn diagrams as a visual representation for sets,\n      set operations, and set relationships.\n      In that activity, we restricted ourselves to using two sets.\n      We can, of course, include more than two sets in a Venn diagram.\n       \n      shows a general Venn diagram for three sets\n      (including a shaded region that corresponds to  ).\n     \n      In this diagram, there are eight distinct regions,\n      and each region has a unique reference number.\n      For example,\n      the set   is

We need to show that   is a subset of   or that  ,\n              where   is some subset of  .\n              There are two cases to consider: (1)   is not an element of  ,\n              and (2)   is an element of  .\n             \n              Case 1: Assume that  .\n              Let  .\n              Then   and  .\n              Since\n               ,\n              this means that   must be in  .\n              Therefore,  .\n             \n              Case 2: Assume that  .\n              In this case, let  .\n              Then every element of   is an element of  .\n              Hence, we can conclude that\n                and that  .\n             \n              Cases (1) and (2) show that if  ,\n              then   or  , where\n               . \n             \n         \n          To begin the induction proof of  ,\n          for each nonnegative integer  , we let   be,\n           If   a finite set has exactly    elements,\n          then  that set  has exactly    subsets. \n            \n         \n          Verify that   is true.\n          (This is the basis step for the induction proof.)\n         \n          Verify that   and   are true.\n         \n          Now assume that   is a nonnegative integer and assume that   is true.\n          That is, assume that if a set has   elements,\n          then that set has   subsets.\n          (This is the inductive assumption for the induction proof.)\n          Let   be a subset of the universal set with\n           , and let  .\n          Then the set   has   elements.\n          Now use the inductive assumption to determine how many subsets   has.\n          Then use  \n          to prove that   has twice as many subsets as  .\n          This should help complete the inductive step for the induction proof.\n         "

Beginning Activity 2: Working with Venn Diagrams \n            Draw a Venn diagram for two sets,   and  ,\n            with the assumption that   is a subset of  .\n            On this Venn diagram,\n            lightly shade the area corresponding to  .\n            Then, determine the region on the Venn diagram that corresponds to  .\n            What appears to be the relationship between   and  ?\n            Explain.\n           \n            Draw a general Venn diagram for two sets,   and  .\n            First determine the region that corresponds to the set   and then,\n            on the Venn diagram,\n            shade the region corresponding to\n              and shade the region corresponding to  .\n            What appears to be the relationship between these two sets?\n            Explain.\n           \n      In this section,\n      we will learn how to prove certain relationships about sets.\n      Two of the most basic types of relationships between sets are the equality relation and \n      the subset relation.\n      So if we are asked a question of the form,\n       How are the sets   and   related? , we can answer the question if we \n      can prove that the two sets are equal or that one set is a subset of the other set.\n      There are other ways to answer this,\n      but we will concentrate on these two for now.\n      This is similar to asking a question about how two real numbers are related.\n      Two real numbers can be related by the fact that they are equal or by the fact that one \n      number is less than the other number.\n     The Choose-an-Element Method choose-an-element method choose-an-element method. \n      In this case, the\n       element \n      is an integer, the\n       given property \n      is that it is an element of  , and the\n       something that happens \n      is that the element is also an element of  .\n      One way to approach this is to create a list of all elements with the given \n      property and verify that for each one, the\n       something happens. \n      When the list is short, this may be a reasonable approach.\n      However, as in this case, when the list is infinite\n      (or even just plain long),\n      this approach is not practical.\n     choose-an-element method \n          Let S be the set of all integers that are multiples of 6, and let T be the set of \n          all even integers.\n          Then S is a subset of T.\n         \n        Let   be the set of all integers that are multiples of 6, and let   be \n        the set of all even integers.\n        We will show that   is a subset of   by showing that if an integer \n          is an element of  ,\n        then it is also an element of  .\n       \n        Let  . (Note: The use of the word\n         let \n        is often an indication that the we are choosing an arbitrary element.) This means that \n          is a multiple of 6.\n        Therefore, there exists an integer   such that\n         .\n\n        Since  , this equation can be written in the form\n         .\n\n        By closure properties of the integers,   is an integer.\n        Hence, this last equation proves that   must be even.\n        Therefore, we have shown that if   is an element of  ,\n        then   is an element of  ,\n        and hence that  . \n       \n      Having proved that   is a subset of  ,\n      we can now ask if   is actually equal to  .\n      The work we did in  Beginning Activity 1 \n      can help us answer this question.\n      In that activity,\n      we should have found several elements that are in   but not in  .\n      For example, the integer 2 is in   since 2 is even but\n        since 2 is not a multiple of 6.\n      Therefore,   and we can also conclude that   is a proper subset of \n       .\n     \n      One reason we do this in a\n       two-step \n      process is that it is much easier to work with the subset relation than the proper \n      subset relation.\n      The subset relation is defined by a conditional statement and most of our work in \n      mathematics deals with proving conditional statements.\n      In addition,\n      the proper subset relation is a conjunction of two statements (  \n      and  ) and so it is natural to deal with the two parts of the conjunction \n      separately.\n     Subsets and Set Equality \n        Let   \n        and let  .\n       \n              Is the set   a subset of  ?\n              Justify your conclusion.\n             \n                The set   is a subset of  .\n                To prove this, we let  .\n                Then there exists an integer   such that  ,\n                which can be written as\n                 .\n                Since  ,\n                the last equation proves that   is a multiple of 3 and so  .\n                Therefore,  .\n               \n              Is the set   equal to the set  ?\n              Justify your conclusion.\n             \n                The set   is not equal to the set  .\n                We note that   but  .\n                Therefore,   and, hence,  .\n               Using the Choose-an-Element Method choose-an-element method \n        The Venn diagram in  Beginning Activity 2 \n        suggests that the following proposition is true.\n      \n      \n       \n            Let   and   be subsets of the universal set  .\n            If  , then  .\n           \n       \n            The conclusion of the conditional statement is  .\n            Explain why we should try the choose-an-element method to prove this proposition.\n           \n            Complete the following know-show table for this proposition and explain exactly \n            where the choose-an-element method is used.\n             Step Know Reason Hypothesis Let  .

The area outside of B is shaded.\n       \n      From the Venn diagram, it appears that  .\n      This means that   and   are disjoint.\n      The preceding example suggests that the following proposition is true: \n       \n        If \n         ,\n        then  .\n       \n      If we would like to prove this proposition, a reasonable\n       backward question \n      is,\n       How do we prove that a set\n        is equal to the empty set? \n     \n      This question seems difficult to answer since how do we prove that a set is empty?\n      This is an instance where proving the contrapositive or using a proof by contradiction \n      could be reasonable approaches.\n      To illustrate these methods,\n      let us assume the proposition we are trying to prove is of the following form: \n       \n        If  ,\n        then  .\n       \n      If we choose to prove the contrapositive or use a proof by contradiction,\n      we will assume that  .\n      These methods can be outlined as follows:\n       \n           \n            The contrapositive of\n             If  , then  \n            is,\n             If  , then  . \n            So in this case, we would assume\n              and try to prove  .\n           \n         \n           \n            Using a proof by contradiction,\n            we would assume   and assume that  .\n            From these two assumptions, we would attempt to derive a contradiction.\n           \n         \n  \n      One advantage of these methods is that when we assume that  ,\n      then we know that there exists an element in the set  .\n      We can then use that element in the rest of the proof.\n      We will prove one of the conditional statements for  \n      by proving its contrapositive.\n      The proof of the other conditional statement associated with  \n      is  .\n     \n          Let   and   be subsets of some universal set.\n          Then   if and only if  .\n         \n        Let   and   be subsets of some universal set.\n        We will first prove that if  ,\n        then  ,\n        by proving its contrapositive.\n        That is, we will prove \n         \n          If  ,\n          then  .\n         \n        So assume that  .\n        We will prove that   by proving that there must exist an \n        element   such that   and  .\n       \n        Since  ,\n        there exists an element   that is in  .\n        This means that\n         .\n\n        Now, the fact that   means that  .\n        Hence, we can conclude that\n         .\n\n        This means that  , and hence,\n        we have proved that if  ,\n        then  , and therefore,\n        we have proved that if  ,\n        then  .\n       \n        The proof that if  ,\n        then   is  . \n       Proving Two Sets Are Disjoint \n        Proof: It has been noted that it is often possible to prove that two sets are disjoint by \n        using a proof by contradiction.\n        In this case,\n        we assume that the two sets are not disjoint and hence,\n        their intersection is not empty.\n        Use this method to prove that the following two sets are disjoint.\n         .\n       \n          Let   and \n           .\n          We will use a proof by contradiction to prove that  .\n          So we assume that   and let  .\n          We can then conclude that   and that  .\n          This means that there exist integers   and   such that\n           .\n         \n          By equating these two expressions for  ,\n          we obtain  ,\n          and this equation can be rewritten as  .\n          This is a contradiction since 1 is an odd integer and   is an even integer.\n          We have therefore proved that  .\n         A Final Comment element-chasing proof proof element-chasing choose-an-element method element-chasing proofs. \n        Let   and let \n         .\n       \n        Is  ?\n        Justify your conclusion with a proof or a counterexample.\n       \n          The set     is  a subset of   .  To prove this, we let   . Then\n           .  Since   , we conclude that    \n          and hence, we have proved that   is a subset of  .\n         \n        Is  ?\n        Justify your conclusion with a proof or a counterexample.\n       \n          The set     is not a subset of   .  There are many examples of a real \n          number that is in     but not in   .  For example,   is in \n           , but   is not in  .\n         \n        Let  ,  ,\n        and   be subsets of a universal set  .\n       \n        Draw a Venn diagram with   and  .\n        Does it appear that  ?\n       \n        Prove the following proposition: \n         \n          If\n            and  ,\n          then  .\n          \n       \n        Note: This may seem like an obvious result.\n        However, one of the reasons for this exercise is to provide practice at properly \n        writing a proof that one set is a subset of another set.\n        So we should start the proof by assuming that\n          and  .\n        Then we should choose an arbitrary element of  .\n       \n        Let   and \n         .\n       \n        List at least five different elements of

  \n          To prove that  , let  .\n          Then,   and so,\n           .\n          This means that there exists an integer   such that  .\n          By adding 4 to both sides of this equation,\n          we see that  ,\n          or  .\n          From this, we conclude that\n            and that  .\n          Hence,  .\n         \n        Is  ?\n        Justify your conclusion with a proof or a counterexample.\n       \n           .\n          For example,   and  .\n         \n        Let   and \n         .\n       \n        List at least five different elements of the set

hence,  .\n          Conversely, if  ,\n          then there exists an integer   such that  .\n          Hence,  ,\n          which implies that   and  .\n          Therefore,  .\n         \n          and \n         .\n       \n          and \n         .\n       \n           .\n          To prove this,\n          we will use a proof by contradiction and assume that  .\n          So there exists an

about set operations.\n        When we do this,\n        we say that we are using the algebra of sets to prove the result.\n        For example,\n        we can start by using one of the basic properties in \n          to write\n         .\n       \n        We can then use one of the commutative properties to write\n         .\n       \n        Determine which properties from  \n        and

theorems when \n        the theorems use the same letters to represent the sets as those being used in \n        the current problem.\n        For example,\n        one of the distributive properties from  \n        can be written as follows: For all sets  ,  ,\n        and   that are subsets of a universal set  ,\n         .\n       \n           \n         Proving that Statements Are Equivalent \n      When we have a list of three statements  ,  ,\n      and   such that each statement in the list is equivalent to the other two statements \n      in the list,\n      we say that the three statements are equivalent.\n      This means that each of the statements in the list implies each of the other statements \n      in the list.\n     \n      The purpose of  Beginning Activity 2 \n      was to provide one way to prove that three\n      (or more)\n      statements are equivalent.\n      The basic idea is to prove a sequence of conditional statements so that there is an \n      unbroken chain of conditional statements from each statement to every other statement.\n      This method of proof will be used in  .\n     \n          Let   and   be subsets of some universal set  .\n          The following are equivalent:\n           \n               \n                 \n               \n             \n               \n                 \n               \n             \n               \n                 \n               \n             \n         \n        To prove that these are equivalent conditions,\n        we will prove that   implies  ,\n        that   implies  ,\n        and that   implies  .\n       \n        Let   and   be subsets of some universal set  .\n        We have proved that   implies   \n        in  .\n       \n        To prove that   implies  ,\n        we will assume that   and use the fact that \n         .\n        We then see that\n         .\n\n        Then, using one of De Morgan's Laws, we obtain\n         \n       \n        This completes the proof that   implies \n         .\n       \n        We now need to prove that   implies  .\n        We assume that   and will prove that\n          by proving that every element of   must be in  .\n       \n        So let  .\n        Then we know that  .\n        However,   and since  ,\n        we can conclude that  .\n        Since  , we conclude that  .\n        This proves that   and hence that \n          implies  .\n       \n        Since we have now proved that   implies  ,\n        that   implies  ,\n        and that   implies  ,\n        we have proved that the three conditions are equivalent. \n       \n          Let   be a subset of some universal set  .\n          Prove each of the following (from  ):\n         \n           \n         \n            Let   . Then   , which means  . Hence,\n             . Now let  . Then,\n              and hence,  .

Also, since every set we deal with is a \n            subset of the universal set,\n             .\n           \n           \n         \n          Let   ,  ,\n          and     be subsets of some universal set   .\n          As part of  ,\n          we proved one of the distributive laws.\n          Prove the other one.\n          That is, prove that\n           .\n         \n          To prove that  , we let  .  Then   and\n           .  So we will use two cases:\n          (1)  ; (2)  .\n         \n          In Case (1),   and, hence, \n           .  In Case (2),\n            and, hence,  . \n          This proves that  .\n         \n          To prove that  ,\n          let  . Then, \n            or\n           .  If  , then   and  . \n          Therefore,   and\n           .  So, we may conclude that \n           . In a similar manner, we can prove that if \n           , then  .

open sentence with two variables.\n        An element of the truth set of this open sentence\n        (also called a solution of the equation)\n        is an ordered pair   of real numbers so that when   is substituted for   and   is substituted for  ,\n        the open sentence becomes a true statement (a true equation in this case).\n        For example,\n        we see that the ordered pair   is in the truth set for this open sentence since\n         \n        is a true statement.\n        On the other hand,\n        the ordered pair   is not in the truth set for this open sentence since\n         \n        is a false statement.\n       \n        Important Note: The order of the two numbers in the ordered pair is very important.\n        We are using the convention that the first number is to be substituted for   \n        and the second number is to be substituted for  .\n        With this convention,\n          is a solution of the equation  ,\n        but   is not a

using set builder notation.\n             Beginning Activity 2: The Cartesian Product of Two Sets \n        In  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n        we worked with ordered pairs without providing a formal definition of an ordered pair.\n        We instead relied on your previous work with ordered pairs,\n        primarily from graphing equations with two variables.\n        Following is a formal definition of an ordered pair.\n       Definition ordered pair coordinates ordered pair coordinates first coordinate second coordinate \n        We will now introduce a new set operation that gives a way of combining elements from \n        two given sets to form ordered pairs.\n        The basic idea is that we will create a set of ordered pairs.\n       Definition Cartesian product Cartesian

       Cartesian Products \n      When working with Cartesian products,\n      it is important to remember that the Cartesian product of two sets is itself a set.\n      As a set, it consists of a collection of elements.\n      In this case,\n      the elements of a Cartesian product are ordered pairs.\n      We should think of an ordered pair as a single object that consists of two other objects \n      in a specified order.\n      For example,\n       \n           \n            If  , then the ordered pair\n              is not equal to the ordered pair  .\n            That is,  .\n

  and  ,\n            then the ordered pair   is not an element of the set\n              since  .\n            That is,  .\n           \n         \n     \n      In  ,\n      we studied certain properties of set union, set intersection,\n      and set complements, which we called the algebra of sets.\n      We will now begin something similar for Cartesian products.\n      We begin by examining some specific examples in  \n      and a little later in  .\n     Relationships between Cartesian Products \n        Let  ,\n         ,\n          , and  .\n        We can then form new sets

     \n            List all the relationships between the sets in \n              that you observe.\n           \n                \n             \n               \n             \n                \n             \n               \n             The Cartesian Plane Cartesian plane Cartesian plane Cartesian plane Cartesian plane. \n      The basic idea is that each ordered pair of real numbers corresponds to a point in the plane,\n      and each point in the plane corresponds to an ordered pair of real numbers.\n      This geometric representation of\n        is an extension of the geometric representation of\n        as a straight line whose points correspond to real numbers.\n     \n      Since the Cartesian product\n        corresponds to the Cartesian plane,\n      the Cartesian product of two subsets of\n        corresponds to a subset of the Cartesian plane.\n      For example,\n      if   is the interval  ,\n      and   is the interval  , then\n       .\n     \n      A graph of the set   can then be drawn in the Cartesian plane as shown \n      in  .\n     Cartesian Product  \n        A graph with the x-axis extending from 0 to 4 and y-axis from 0 to 6. A shaded \n        box extends from 1 to 3 on the x-axis and 2 to 5 on the y-axis.\n       \n      This illustrates that the graph of a Cartesian product of two intervals of finite length in\n        corresponds to the interior of a rectangle and possibly some or all of its boundary.\n      The solid line for the boundary in  \n      indicates that the boundary is included.\n      In this case,\n      the Cartesian product contained all of the boundary of the rectangle.\n      When the graph does not contain a portion of the boundary,\n      we usually draw that portion of the boundary with a dotted line.\n     \n      Note: A Caution about Notation.\n      The standard notation for an open interval in\n        is the same as the notation for an ordered pair,\n      which is an element of \\mbox{ } . We need to use the \n      context in which the notation is used to determine which interpretation is intended.\n      For example,\n       \n           \n            If we write  ,\n            then we are using   to represent an ordered pair of real numbers.\n           \n         \n           \n            If we write   ,\n            then we are interpreting    as an open interval.\n            We could write\n             .\n           \n         \n     \n      The following progress check explores some of the same ideas explored in \n       \n      except that intervals of real numbers are used for the sets.\n     Cartesian Products of Intervals interval Cartesian product   \n        We will use the following intervals that are subsets of  .\n         \n       \n            Draw a graph of each of the following subsets of the Cartesian plane and write each \n            subset using set builder notation.\n           \n                 \n               \n                   \n

indicate the plausibility of many of the results contained in the next theorem.\n     \n          Let  ,  , and   be sets.\n          Then\n           \n               \n                 \n

then  .\n               \n             \n               \n                If  , then  .\n               \n             \n         \n      We will not prove all these results;\n      rather, we will prove   of \n       \n      and leave some of the rest to the exercises.\n      In constructing these proofs,\n      we need to keep in mind that Cartesian products are sets,\n      and so we follow many of the same principles to prove set relationships that were \n      introduced in  \n      and  .\n     \n      The other thing to remember is that the elements of a Cartesian product are ordered pairs.\n      So when we start a proof of a result such as   of \n       ,\n      the primary goal is to prove that the two sets are equal.\n      We will do this by proving that each one is a subset of the other one.\n      So if we want to prove that  ,\n      we can start by choosing an arbitrary element of  .\n      The goal is then to show that this element must be in  .\n      When we start by choosing an arbitrary element of  ,\n      we could give that element a name.\n      For example, we could start by letting\n       .\n\n      We can then use the definition of\n       ordered pair \n      to conclude that\n       .\n\n      In order to prove that  ,\n      we must now show that the ordered pair   from (1) is \n      in  .\n      In order to do this,\n      we can use the definition of set union and prove that\n       .\n\n      Since  ,\n      we can prove   by proving that\n       .\n     \n      If we look at the sentences in  \n      and  ,\n      it would seem that we are very close to proving that  .\n      Following is a proof of   of \n       .\n      of  \n          Let  ,  , and   be sets.\n          Then\n           .\n         \n        Let  ,  , and   be sets.\n        We will prove that   is equal to\n          by proving \n        that each set is a subset of the other set.\n       \n        To prove that  ,\n        we let  .\n        Then there exists   and there exists\n          such that  .\n        Since  , we know that   or  .\n       \n        In the case where  ,\n        we have  ,\n        where   and  .\n        So in this case,  ,\n        and hence  .\n        Similarly, in the case where  ,\n        we have  ,\n        where   and  .\n        So in this case,   and, hence,\n         .\n       \n        In both cases,\n         .\n        Hence, we may conclude that if   is an element of  ,\n        then  ,\n        and this proves that\n         .\n       \n        We must now prove that  .\n        So we let  .\n        Then   or  .\n       \n        In the case where  ,\n        we know that there exists   and there exists   such that \n         .\n        But since  ,\n        we know that  ,\n        and hence  .\n        Similarly, in the case where  ,\n        we know that there exists   and there exists   such that \n         .\n        But because  ,\n        we can conclude that   and,\n        hence,  .\n       \n        In both cases,  .\n        Hence, we may conclude that if\n       \n         ,\n        then  , and this proves that\n         .\n       \n        The relationships in   and  \n        prove that  . \n       \n      Final Note:\n      The definition of an ordered pair in  Beginning Activity 2 \n      may have seemed like a lengthy definition,\n      but in some areas of mathematics,\n      an even more formal and precise definition of\n       ordered pair \n      is needed.\n      This definition is explored in  .\n     \n          Let  ,\n           ,\n          and  .\n          Use the roster method to list all of the elements of each of the following sets:\n         \n            \n         \n             .\n           \n           \n         \n             .\n           \n           \n         \n             .\n           \n           \n         \n             .\n           \n           \n         \n             .\n           \n           \n         \n             .\n           \n           \n         \n             .\n           \n           \n         \n             .\n           \n          Sketch a graph of each of the following Cartesian products in the Cartesian plane.\n         \n           \n         \n           \n         \n           \n         \n           \n         \n           \n         \n           \n         \n           \n         \n           \n         \n          Prove  ,  :\n           .\n         \n          Let  . Then, there exists   and there exists    such that   .  Since   , we know that    and   .  So,  we have:\n            and   .\n           \n          Hence,   and this \n          proves that\n           .\n          Now let  . Then,\n            and  .  So, there exists an   in \n            and a   in   such that  . \n          But, since   is also in  , we see that   must also be \n          in  . Thus,   and so,  . This proves that  .\n         \n          Prove  ,  :\n           .\n         \n          Let  . Then, there exists \n            and there exists   such that \n           . Since   , we know that \n             or   . In the case where  , we see that \n           , and in the case where  , we see that \n           .  Hence,\n           .  This proves that\n           .\n          We still need to prove that  .\n         \n          Prove  ,  :\n           .\n         \n          Prove  ,  : \n          If  ,\n          then  .\n         \n          Let  .\n         \n          Explain why  .\n         \n          Explain why  .\n         \n          Let   and   be nonempty sets.\n          Prove that   if and only if  .\n         \n          Is the following proposition true or false?\n          Justify your conclusion.\n           \n            Let  ,  , and   be sets with  .

is the associative law that allows us to discuss the union of three sets.\n        Using the associate law,\n        if  ,\n         , and   are subsets of some universal set,\n        then we can

Activity 2: An Indexed Family of Sets \n        We often use subscripts to identify sets.\n        For example,\n        in  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n        instead of using  ,\n         ,  , and   as the names of the sets,\n        we could have used  ,\n         ,  , and  .\n        When we do this,\n        we are using the subscript as an identifying tag, or index,\n        for each set.\n        We can also use this idea to specify an infinite family of sets.\n        For example, for each natural number  , we define\n         .\n\n        So if we have a family of sets  ,\n        we use the notation   to mean the same thing as \n         .\n       \n            Determine   and  .\n           \n        We can see that with the use of subscripts,\n        we do not even have to define the family of sets  .\n        We can work with the infinite family of sets\n         \n        and use the subscripts to indicate which sets to use in a union or an intersection.\n       \n            Use the roster method to specify each of the following pairs of sets.\n            The universal set is  .\n           \n              and  \n           \n              and  \n           \n              and  \n           \n              and \n             \n           The Union and Intersection of an Indexed Family of Sets union of a finite family of sets intersection of a finite family of sets union of an infinite family of sets intersection of an infinite family of sets \n      One of the purposes of the beginning activities was to show that we often encounter \n      situations in which more than two sets are involved,\n      and it is possible to define the union and intersection of more than two sets.\n      In  Beginning Activity 2 ,\n      we also saw that it is often convenient to\n       index \n      the sets in a family of sets.\n      In particular, if   is a natural number and\n        is a family of   sets,\n      then the union of these   sets,\n      denoted by   or  ,\n      is defined as\n       .\n \n      We can also define the intersection of these   sets,\n      denoted by   or  , as\n       .\n \n      We can also extend this idea to define the union and intersection of a family that \n      consists of infinitely many sets.\n      So if  , then\n       \n     An Infinite Family of Sets \n        For each natural number  ,\n        let  .\n        For example,\n         ,\n\n        and\n         \n       \n        Determine each of the following sets:\n       \n              \n           \n               \n             \n             \n

            \n             \n           \n               \n             \n      In all of the examples we have studied so far,\n      we have used   or a subset of   to index or label the sets in a family \n      of sets.\n      We can use other sets to index or label sets in a family of sets.\n      For example, for each real number  ,\n      we can define   to be the closed interval  .\n      That is,\n       .\n\n      So we make the following definition.\n      In this definition,\n        is the uppercase Greek letter lambda and   is the \n      lowercase Greek letter alpha.\n     Definition indexed family of sets family of sets indexed indexing set indexed family of sets index indexing set Indexed Families of Sets \n        In each of the indexed families of sets that we seen so far,\n        if the indices were different,\n        then the sets were different.\n        That is, if   is an indexing set for the family of sets \n         ,\n        then if   and  ,\n

D. Aczel,\n                 Fermat's Last Theorem: Unlocking the Secret of an Ancient \n                Mathematical Problem , Dell Publishing, New York, 1996.)\n                Andrew Wiles's birthday

possible to find two different natural numbers   and   \n                such that  ?\n                Explain.\n               \n                Use your responses in  \n                  to determine the truth value of each of the \n                following statements.\n               \n                    For each  ,\n                    there exists a natural number   such that  .\n                   \n                    For all  ,\n                    if  , then  .\n                   The Definition of a Function \n      The concept of a function is much more general than the idea of a function used in \n      calculus or precalculus.\n      In particular,\n      the domain and codomain do not have to be subsets of  .\n      In addition,\n      the way in which a function associates elements of the domain with elements of the \n      codomain can have many different forms.\n      This input-output rule can be a formula, a graph, a table,\n      a random process, a computer algorithm, or a verbal description.\n      Two such examples were introduced in  Beginning Activity 2 .\n     birthday function sum of the divisors function \n      We formally define the concept of a function as follows:\n     Definition function mapping function mapping Function Notation function from   to  \n      \n      When we work with a function,\n      we usually give it a name.\n      The name is often a single letter,\n      such as   or  .\n      If   is a function from the set   to the set  ,\n      we will write  .\n      This is simply shorthand notation for the fact that   is a function from the \n      set   to the set  .\n      In this case,\n      we also say that   maps   to  .\n     Definition domain of a function function domain codomain function codomain image of an element preimage of an element domain codomain image of   under  preimage of\n            for  Some Function Terminology with an Example .\n       independent variable variable independent dependent variable variable dependent independent variable dependent variable \n      For a specific example,\n      consider the function  ,\n      where   is defined by the formula\n       .\n\n      Note that this is indeed a function since given any input   in the domain,\n       ,\n      there is exactly one output   in the codomain,\n       .\n      For example,\n       .\n\n      So we say that the image of   under   is 2, the image of 5 under \n        is 23, and so on.\n     \n      Notice in this case that the number 0 in the codomain has two preimages,\n       .\n      This does not violate the mathematical definition of a function since the definition \n      only states that each input must produce one and only one output.\n      That is, each element of the domain has exactly one image in the codomain.\n      Nowhere does the definition stipulate that two different inputs must produce different outputs.\n     \n      Finding the preimages of an element in the codomain can sometimes be difficult.\n      In general, if   is in the codomain,\n      to find its preimages, we need to ask,\n       For which values of   in the domain will we have  ? \n      For example, for the function  ,\n      to find the preimages of 5, we need to find all   for which  .\n      In this case, since  ,\n      we can do this by solving the equation\n       .\n\n      The solutions of this equation are   and  .\n      So for the function  ,\n      the preimages of 5 are   and  .\n      We often use set notation for this and say that the set of preimages of 5 for the \n      function   is  .\n     \n      Also notice that for this function,\n      not every element in the codomain has a preimage.\n      For example,\n      there is no input   such that  .\n      This is true since for all real numbers  ,\n        and hence  .\n      This means that for all   in  ,\n       .\n     \n      Finally, note that we introduced the function   with the sentence,\n       Consider the function  ,\n      where   is defined by the formula  . \n      This is one correct way to do this,\n      but we will frequently shorten this to,\n       Let   be defined by  , or\n       Let  ,\n      where  . \n     Images and Preimages \n        Let   be defined by\n          for all  ,\n        and let   be defined by\n          for all  .\n       \n              Determine   and  .\n             \n                   \n               \n              Determine   and  .\n             \n                 ,  \n               \n              Determine the set of all preimages of 6 for the function  .\n             \n                 \n               \n              Determine the set of all preimages of 6 for the function  .\n             \n                 \n               \n              Determine the set of all preimages of 2 for the function  .\n             \n                 \n               \n              Determine the set of all preimages of 2 for the function  .\n             \n                 \n               The Codomain and Range of a Function \n      Besides the domain and codomain,\n      there is another important set associated with a function.\n      The need for this was illustrated in the example of the function   in \n       .\n      For this function,\n      it was noticed that there are elements in the codomain that have no preimage or,\n      equivalently,\n      there are elements in the codomain that are not the image of any element in the domain.\n      The set we are talking about is the subset of the codomain consisting of all images of the \n      elements of the domain of the function,\n      and it is called the range of the function.\n     Definition range function range range of the function  image of the function  image of\n            under  \n      The range of   could equivalently be defined as follows:\n       .\n\n      Notice that this means that\n        but does not necessarily mean \n      that  .\n      Whether we have this set equality or not depends on the function  .\n      More about this will be explored in  .\n     Codomain and Range \n            Let   be the function that assigns to each person his or her birthday\n            (month and day).\n           \n                  What is the domain of this function?\n                 \n                    The domain of the function   is the set of all people.\n                   \n                  What is a codomain for this function?\n                 \n                    A codomain for the function   is the set of all days in a leap year.\n                   \n                  In  Beginning Activity 2 ,\n                  we determined that the following statement is true: For each day   \n                  of the year,\n                  there exists a person   such that  .\n                  What does this tell us about the range of the function  ?\n                  Explain.\n                 \n                    This means that the range of the function   is equal to its codomain.\n                   \n            Let   be the function that associates with each natural number the sum of \n            its distinct natural number factors.\n           \n                  What is the domain of this function?\n                 \n                    The domain of the function   is the set of natural numbers.\n                   \n                  What is a codomain for this function?\n                 \n                    A codomain for the function   is the set of natural numbers.\n                   \n                  In  Beginning Activity 2 ,\n                  we determined that the following statement is false:\n                   \n                    For each  , there exists a natural number   such that  .\n                   \n                \n                Give an example of a natural number   that shows this statement is false,\n                and explain what this tells us about the range of the function  .\n                 \n                  This means that the range of   is not equal to the set of natural numbers.\n                 The Graph of a Real Function \n      We will finish this section with methods to visually communicate information about two \n      specific types of functions.\n      The first is the familiar method of graphing functions that was a major part of some \n      previous mathematics courses.\n      For example, consider the function\n        defined by  .\n     Graph of  , where   Graph of a parabola opening up \n          extending from x = -2 to x = 4 and y = -2 to y = 6.\n           real function Using the Graph of a Real Function \n        The graph in   shows the graph of\n        (slightly more than)\n        two complete periods for a function  ,\n        where   for some positive real number constants \n          and  .\n       Graph of  \n            We can use the graph to estimate the output for various inputs.\n            This is done by estimating the  -coordinate for the point on the graph with a \n            specified  -coordinate.\n            On the graph,\n            draw vertical lines at   and   and estimate the values \n            of   and  .\n           \n                and  .\n             \n            Similarly, we can estimate inputs of the function that produce a specified output.\n            This is done by estimating the  -coordinates of the points on the graph that \n            have a specified  -coordinate.\n            Draw a horizontal line at   and estimate at least two values of   \n            such that  .\n           \n              Values of   for which\n                are approximately  , and 3.5.\n             \n            Use the graph in  \n            to estimate the range of the function  .\n           \n              The range of   appears to be the closed interval\n                or  .\n             Arrow Diagrams arrow diagram arrow diagram Arrow Diagram for a Function \n          Arrow diagram showing function F, A to B.\n         \n      An arrow diagram can be used when the domain and codomain of the function are finite\n      (and small).\n      We represent the elements of each set with points and then use arrows to show how the \n      elements of the domain are associated with elements of the codomain.\n      For example,\n      the arrow from the point 2 in   to the point   in   represents the \n      fact that  .\n      In this case,\n      we can use the arrow diagram in  \n      to conclude that  .\n     Working with Arrow Diagrams \n        Let   and let  .\n       Arrow Diagrams \n              Which of the arrow diagrams in  \n              can be used to represent a function from   to  ?\n              Explain.\n             \n              For those arrow diagrams that can be used to represent a function from   to  ,\n              determine the range of the function.\n             \n                Only the arrow diagram in Figure (a) can be used to represent a \n                function from   to  .\n                The range of this function is the set  .\n               \n        Let   be defined by  .\n

of certain functions.\n        For example, if  ,\n        then we can use the product rule to obtain\n         .\n       \n            If possible,\n            find the derivative of each of the

codomain of the function,\n            and what is the rule for computing the element of the codomain (output) \n            that is associated with a given element of the domain (input)?\n           Functions Involving Congruences \n       \n      and  \n      state that an integer is congruent\n      (mod  )\n      to its remainder when it is divided by  .\n      (Recall that we always mean the remainder guaranteed by the Division Algorithm,\n      which is the least nonnegative remainder.)\n      Since this remainder is unique and since the only possible remainders for division by \n        are  ,\n      we then know that each integer is congruent, modulo  ,\n      to precisely one of the integers  .\n      So for each natural number  ,\n      we will define a new set   as the set of remainders upon division by  .\n      So\n       .\n\n      For example,\n        and  .\n      We will now explore a method to define a function from   to  .\n     \n      For each  ,\n      we can

second column as the corresponding output.\n      Each input produces exactly one output.\n      So we could write   by\n       .\n      This description and the notation for the outputs of this function are quite cumbersome.\n      So we will use a more concise notation.\n      We will, instead, write Let\n       .\n     Functions Defined by Congruences \n        We have  .\n        Define

Equality of Functions \n      The idea of equality of functions has been in the background of our discussion of functions,\n      and it is now time to discuss it explicitly.\n      The preliminary work for this discussion was  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n      in which  ,\n      and there were two functions:\n       \n           \n             ,\n            where   is the number of diagonals of a convex polygon with   sides\n           \n         \n           \n             ,\n            where  ,\n            for each real number  .\n           \n         \n     \n      In  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n      we saw that these two functions produced the same outputs for certain values of the input\n      (independent variable).\n      For example, we can verify that\n       .\n     \n      Although the functions produce the same outputs for some inputs,\n      these are two different functions.\n      For example,\n      the outputs of the function   are determined by a formula,\n      and the outputs of the function   are determined by a verbal description.\n      This is not enough,\n      however, to say that these are two different functions.\n      Based on the evidence from  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n      we might make the following conjecture: \n       \n        For  ,\n         .\n       \n      Although we have not proved this statement, it is a true statement.\n      (See  .)\n      However, we know the function   and the function   are not the same function.\n      For example,\n       \n           \n             , but 0 is not in the domain of  ;\n           \n         \n           \n             ,\n            but   is not in the domain of  .\n           \n         \n     \n      We thus see the importance of considering the domain and codomain of each of the two functions in determining whether the two functions are equal or not.\n      This motivates the following definition.\n     Definition equal functions function equality equal Equality of Functions identity function identity function on the set  \n        For this progress check,\n        we will use the functions   and   from  .\n        The identity function on the set   is\n         .\n        Is the identity function on   equal to either of the functions   or \n          from  ?\n        Explain.\n       \n            and  .\n         Mathematical Processes as Functions \n      Certain mathematical processes can be thought of as functions.\n      In  Beginning Activity 2 ,\n      we reviewed how to find the derivatives of certain functions,\n      and we considered whether or not we could think of this differentiation process as a function.\n      If we use a differentiable function as the input and consider the derivative of that function to be the output,\n      then we have the makings of a function.\n      Computer algebra systems such as\n       Maple  and  Mathematica \n      have this derivative function as one of their predefined operators.\n     \n      Different computer algebra systems will have different syntax for entering functions \n      and for the derivative function.\n      The first step will be to input a real function  .\n      This is usually done by entering a formula for  ,\n      which is valid for all real numbers   for which   is defined.\n      The next step is to apply the derivative function to the function  .\n      For purposes of illustration,\n      we will use   to represent this derivative function.\n      So this function will give  .\n     \n      For example, if we enter\n       \n      for the function  , we will get  .\n     \n      We must be careful when determining the domain for the derivative function since there \n      are functions that are not differentiable.\n      To make things reasonably easy,\n      we will let   be the set of all real functions that are differentiable and call \n      this the domain of the derivative function  .\n      We will use the set   of all real functions as the codomain.\n      So our function   is\n       .\n     Average of a Finite Set of Numbers average of a finite set of numbers average of the set  \n              Find the average of  .\n             \n                3.5\n               \n              Find the average of  .\n             \n                4.02\n               \n              Find the average of  .\n             \n                 \n               \n              Now let   be the set of all nonempty finite subsets of \n               .\n              That is, a subset   of   is in\n                if and only if   contains only a finite number of elements.\n              Carefully explain how the process of finding the average of a finite subset of \n                can be thought of as a function.\n              In doing this,\n              be sure to specify the domain of the function and the codomain of the function.\n             \n                The process of finding the average of a finite set of real numbers can be \n                thought of as a function from   to  .\n                So the domain is  ,\n                the codomain is  ,\n                and we can define a function   as \n                follows: If\n                  and  ,\n                then  .\n               Sequences as Functions \n      A sequence can be considered to be an infinite list of objects that are indexed \n      (subscripted) by the natural numbers\n      (or some infinite subset of  ).\n      Using this idea, we often write a sequence in the following form:\n       .\n     \n      In order to shorten our notation,\n      we will often use the notation\n        to represent this sequence.\n      Sometimes a formula can be used to represent the terms of a sequence,\n      and we might include this formula as the  th term in the list for a sequence such \n      as in the following example:\n       .\n     \n      In this case,\n      the   term of the sequence is  .\n      If we know a formula for the  th term,\n      we often use this formula to represent the sequence.\n      For example,\n      we might say Define the sequence   by\n        for each  .\n      This shows that this sequence is a function with domain  .\n      If it is understood that the domain is  ,\n      we could refer to this as the sequence  .\n      Given an element of the domain,\n      we can consider   to be the output.\n      In this case,\n      we have used subscript notation to indicate the output rather than the usual function notation.\n      We could just as easily write\n       .\n     \n      We make the following formal definition.\n     Definition sequence sequence Sequences \n        Find the sixth and tenth terms of the following sequences,\n        each of whose domain is  :\n       \n               \n             \n                The sixth term is   and the tenth term is  .\n               \n               ,\n              where   for each  \n             \n                The sixth term is   and the tenth term is  .\n               \n               \n             \n                The sixth term is   and the tenth term is  .\n               Functions of Two Variables function of two variables \n      Finding the preimages of an element of the codomain for the function  ,\n       ,\n      usually involves solving an equation with two variables.\n      For example, to find the preimages of  ,\n      we need to find all ordered pairs\n        such that \n       .\n      This means that we must find all ordered pairs \n        such that\n       .\n \n      Three such ordered pairs are  ,\n       ,\n      and  .\n      In fact, whenever we choose an integer value for  ,\n      we can find a corresponding integer   such that  .\n      This means that 0 has infinitely many preimages,\n      and it may be difficult to specify the set of all of the preimages of 0 using the \n      roster method.\n      One way that can be used to specify this set is to use set builder notation and say that \n      the following set consists of all of the preimages of 0:\n       .\n     \n      The second formulation for this set was obtained by solving the equation\n        for  .\n     Working with a Function of Two Variables \n        Let   be defined by\n          for all  .\n       \n              Determine  ,\n               ,  , and  .\n

     \n             \n              For every  ,  .\n              That is, every element of   is an input for the function  .\n              This could also be stated as follows: For each  ,\n              there exists a   such that  .\n             \n           \n             \n              For a given  ,\n              there is exactly one   such that  .\n             \n           \n       \n        The definition of a function does not require that different inputs produce different outputs.\n        That is, it is possible to have   with\n          and  .\n        The arrow diagram for the function   in   \n        illustrates such a function.\n       \n        Also, the definition of a function does not require that the range of the function must \n        equal the codomain.\n        The range is always a subset of the codomain,\n        but these two sets are not required to be equal.\n        That is, if  ,\n        then it is possible to have a   such that\n          for all  .\n        The arrow diagram for the function   in   \n        illustrates such a function.\n       Arrow Diagram for Two Functions \n            Function f has different inputs which do not produce different outputs. \n            The range of function g does not equal the codomain.\n           \n        Now let  ,\n         ,\n        and  .\n        Define\n        by  by  by \n            Which of these functions satisfy the following property for a function  ?\n             \n              For all  , if  , then  .\n             \n           \n            Which of these functions satisfy the following property for a function  ?\n             \n              For all  , if  , then \n               .\n             \n           \n            Determine the range of each of these functions.\n           \n            Which of these functions have their range equal to their codomain?\n           \n            Which of the these functions satisfy the following property for a function  ?\n             \n              For all   in the codomain of  , there exists an \n                such that  .\n             \n           Beginning Activity 2: Statements Involving Functions \n        Let   and   be nonempty sets and let  .\n        In  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n        we determined whether or not certain functions satisfied some specified properties.\n        These properties were written in the form of statements,\n        and we will now examine these statements in more detail.\n       \n            Consider the following statement:\n\n           \n            For all  , if  , then  .\n           \n           \n                Write the contrapositive of this conditional statement.\n               \n                Write the negation of this conditional statement.\n               \n            Now consider the statement:\n             \n              For all  , there exists an   such that  .\n             \n          \n          Write the negation of this statement.\n           \n            Let   be defined by\n             , for all  .\n            Complete the following proofs of the following propositions about the function  .\n          \n

           \n                  We let  ,\n                  and we assume that   and will prove that  .\n                  Since  , we know that\n                   .\n                  (Now prove that in this situation,\n                   .) \n                 \n               \n\n             \n               Proposition 2 \n              \n                 \n                  For all  ,\n                  there exists an   such that  .\n                 \n               \n                 Proof \n                 \n                  We let  .\n                  We will prove that there exists an   such that\n                    by constructing such an   in  .\n                  In order for this to happen,\n                  we need  . \n                 \n                 \n                  (Now solve the equation for   and then \n                  show that for this real number  ,\n                   .)\n                 \n               \n            \n           Injections \n      In previous sections and in  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n      we have seen examples of functions for which there exist different inputs that produce \n      the same output.\n      Using more formal notation,\n      this means that there are functions\n        for which there exist   with\n        and  .\n      The work in the beginning activities was intended to motivate the following definition.\n     Definition injection one-to-one function function one-to-one function injective injection one-to-one function injective function \n      Notice that the condition that specifies that a function   is an injection is given \n      in the form of a conditional statement.\n      As we shall see, in proofs,\n      it is usually easier to use the contrapositive of this conditional statement.\n      Although we did not define the term then,\n      we have already written the contrapositive for the conditional statement in the definition \n      of an injection in   of \n       Beginning Activity 2 .\n      In that activity,\n      we also wrote the negation of the definition of an injection.\n      Following is a summary of this work giving the conditions for   being an injection \n      or not being an injection.\n     \n        Let  \n       \n         The function   is an injection \n        means that\n\n         \n           \n            For all  ,\n            if  , then  ; or\n           \n         \n           \n            For all  ,\n            if  , then  .\n           \n         \n       \n         The function   is not an injection \n        means that\n\n         \n           \n            There exist   such that\n              and  .\n           \n         \n       Working with the Definition of an Injection \n        Now that we have defined what it means for a function to be an injection,\n        we can see that in   of \n         Beginning Actiivty 2 ,\n        we proved that the function   is an injection,\n        where   for all  .\n        Use the definition\n        (or its negation)\n        to determine whether or not the following functions are injections.\n       \n               , where  ,\n               ,\n              and  ,  , and  .\n             \n               , where  ,\n               ,\n              and  ,  , and  .\n             \n                defined by\n                for all  \n             \n                defined by\n                for all  \n             \n                and   defined by\n                for all  .\n             \n                The functions  ,  ,\n                and   are injections.\n                The functions   and   are not injections.\n               Surjections \n      In previous sections and in  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n      we have seen that there exist functions\n        for which  .\n      This means that every element of   is an output of the function   for some \n      input from the set  .\n      Using quantifiers, this means that for every  ,\n      there exists an   such that\n        . One of the objectives of the beginning activities was to motivate the \n      following definition.\n     Definition surjection onto function function onto function surjective surjection onto function onto  surjective function \n      One of the conditions that specifies that a function   is a surjection is given \n      in the form of a universally quantified statement,\n      which is the primary statement used in proving a function is\n      (or is not)\n      a surjection.\n      Although we did not define the term then,\n      we have already written the negation for the statement defining a surjection in \n        of \n       Beginning Activity 2 .\n      We now summarize the conditions for   being a surjection or not being a surjection.\n     \n        Let  \n       \n         The function   is a surjection \n        means that\n         \n           \n             ; or\n           \n         \n           \n            For every  ,\n            there exists an   such that  .\n           \n         \n       \n         The function   is not a surjection \n        means that\n         \n           \n             ; or\n           \n         \n           \n            There exists a   such that for all  ,\n             .\n           \n         \n       \n      One other important type of function is when a function is both an injection and surjection.\n      This type of function is called a bijection.\n     Definition bijection function bijective bijection one-to-one and onto bijective function Working with the Definition of a Surjection \n        Now that we have defined what it means for a function to be a surjection,\n        we can see that in   of \n         Beginning Activity 2 ,\n        we proved that the function   is a surjection,\n        where   for all  .\n        Determine whether or not the following functions are surjections.\n       \n               , where  ,\n               ,\n              and  ,  , and  .\n             \n                defined by\n                for all  .\n             \n                defined by\n                for all  .\n             \n                defined by\n                for all  .\n             \n                The functions   and   are surjections.\n                The functions   and   are not surjections.\n               The Importance of the Domain and Codomain \n      The functions in the next two examples will illustrate why the domain and the codomain \n      of a function are just as important as the rule defining the outputs of a function when we \n      need to determine if the function is a surjection.\n     A Function that Is Neither an Injection nor a Surjection \n          Let   be defined by  .\n          Notice that\n           .\n         \n          This is enough to prove that the function   is not an injection since this \n          shows that there exist two different inputs that produce the same output.\n         \n          Since  ,\n          we know that   for all  .\n          This implies that the function   is not a surjection.\n          For example,   is in the codomain of   and\n            for all   in the domain of  .\n         A Function that Is Not an Injection but Is a Surjection \n          Let  ,\n          and define   by  .\n          As in  ,\n          the function   is not an injection since  .\n         \n          Is the function   a surjection?\n          That is, does   map   onto  ?\n          As in  ,\n          we do know that   for all  .\n         \n          To see if it is a surjection,\n          we must determine if it is true that for every  ,\n          there exists an   such that  .\n          So we choose  .\n          The goal is to determine if there exists an   such that\n           .\n         \n          One way to proceed is to work backward and solve the last equation\n          (if possible)\n          for  .\n          Doing so, we get\n           .\n         \n          Now, since  ,\n          we know that   and hence that  .\n          This means that  .\n          Hence, if we use  ,\n          then  , and\n           .\n         \n          This proves that   is a surjection since we have shown that for all  ,\n          there exists an   such that  .\n          Notice that for each  ,\n          this was a constructive proof of the existence of an\n            such that  .\n         An Important Lesson \n      \n      In  \n      and  ,\n      the same mathematical formula was used to determine the outputs for the functions.\n      However, one function was not a surjection and the other one was a surjection.\n      This illustrates the important fact that whether a function is surjective depends not \n      only on the formula that defines the output of the function but also on the domain and \n      codomain of the function.\n     \n      The next example will show that whether or not a function is an injection also depends \n      on the domain of the function.\n     A Function that Is an Injection but Is Not a Surjection \n          Let  .\n          Define   by  .\n          (Notice that this is the same formula used in  \n          and  .)\n          Following is a table of values for some inputs for the function  .\n         0 1 1 2 2 5 3 10 4 17 5 26 \n          Notice that the codomain is  ,\n          and the table of values suggests that some natural numbers are not outputs of this function.\n          So it appears that the function   is not a surjection.\n         \n          To prove that   is not a surjection,\n          pick an element of   that does not appear to be in the range.\n          We will use 3, and we will use a proof by contradiction to prove that there is no \n            in the domain\n            such that  .\n          So we assume that there exists an\n            with  .\n          Then\n           .\n         \n          But this is not possible since  .\n          Therefore, there is no   with  .\n          This means that for every  ,  .\n          Therefore, 3 is not in the range of  ,\n          and hence   is not a surjection.\n         \n          The table of values suggests that different inputs produce different outputs,\n          and hence that   is an injection.\n          To prove that   is an injection,\n          assume that  \n          (the domain)\n          with  .\n          Then\n           .\n         \n          Since  ,\n          we know that  .\n          So the preceding equation implies that  .\n          Hence,   is an injection.\n         An Important Lesson \n      The functions in the three preceding examples all used the same formula to determine \n      the outputs.\n      The functions in  \n      and  \n      are not injections but the function in   is an injection.\n      This illustrates the important fact that whether a function is injective not only depends \n      on the formula that defines the output of the function but also on the domain of the function.\n     The Importance of the Domain and Codomain \n        Let  .\n        Define\n          by  , for each  , and\n         \n          by  , for each  .\n         \n        Determine if each of these functions is an injection or a surjection.\n        Justify your conclusions.\n       \n      Note: Before writing proofs,\n      it might be helpful to draw the graph of  .\n      A reasonable graph can be obtained using\n        and  .\n      Please keep in mind that the graph does not prove any conclusion,\n      but may help us arrive at the correct conclusions,\n      which will still need proof.\n     \n        The function   is an injection but not a surjection.\n        To see that it is an injection,\n        let   and assume that  .\n        This implies that  .\n        Now use the natural logarithm function to prove that  .\n        Since   for each real number  ,\n        there is no   such that  .\n        So   is not a surjection.\n       \n        The function   is an injection and is a surjection.\n        The proof that   is an injection is basically the same as the proof that \n          is an injection.\n        To prove that   is a surjection, let  .\n        To construct the real number   such that  ,\n        solve the equation   for  .\n        The solution is  .\n        It can then be verified that  .\n       Working with a Function of Two Variables \n      It takes time and practice to become efficient at working with the formal definitions of \n      injection and surjection.\n      As we have seen, all parts of a function are important\n      (the domain,\n      the codomain, and the rule for determining outputs).\n      This is especially true for functions of two variables.\n     \n      For example,\n      we define   by\n       .\n     \n      Notice that both the domain and the codomain of this function are the set \n       .\n      Thus, the inputs and the outputs of this function are ordered pairs of real numbers.\n      For example,\n       \n     \n      To explore whether or not   is an injection,\n      we assume that  ,\n       ,\n      and  .\n      This means that\n       .\n     \n      Since this equation is an equality of ordered pairs, we see that\n       .\n     \n      By adding the corresponding sides of the two equations in this system,\n      we obtain   and hence,  .\n      Substituting   into either equation in the system give us  .\n      Since   and  , we conclude that\n       .\n     \n      Hence, we have shown that if  ,\n      then  .\n      Therefore,   is an injection.\n     \n      Now, to determine if   is a surjection,\n      we let  ,\n      where   is considered to be an arbitrary element of the codomain of the \n      function  .\n      Can we find

To prove this, let \n              and assume that  .  Then,\n             .\n            Hence,   is an injection.  Now, for each  , \n             , and hence\n             .  This means that there is no integer   \n            such that\n             .

Using calculus, \n            we can see that the function   has a maximum when   and a minimum \n            when  , and so for each  ,   or\n             .\n            This can be used to prove that   is not a surjection.\n            We can also prove that there is no   such that   using a \n            proof by contradiction.

Hence,  .  \n            We can then use the quadratic formula to prove that   is not a real number. \n            Hence, there is no real number   such that   and so   is \n            not a surjection.\n           \n            \n          defined by  ,\n          for all  .\n         \n          For each of the following functions,\n          determine if the function is a bijection.\n          Justify all conclusions.\n         \n            defined by  ,\n          for all  .\n         \n            Let   be defined by   for all\n             .

To prove that   is an \n            injection, we assume that\n             ,\n             , and that\n             . This means that\n             .\n            Since this equation is an equality of ordered pairs, we see that\n             \n            The first equation implies that  .

Therefore,   is an injection.\n           \n            Now, to determine if   is a surjection, we let\n             . To find an ordered pair\n              such that\n             , we need\n             .\n            That is, we need\n             .\n            Solving this system for   and   yields\n             .\n            Since  , we can conclude that   and\n              and hence that\n              .

 Composition of Functions \n      There are several ways to combine two existing functions to create a new function.\n      For example, in calculus,\n      we learned how to form the product and quotient of two functions and then how to use the \n      product rule to determine the derivative of a product of two functions and the quotient \n      rule to determine the derivative of the quotient of two functions.\n     \n      The chain rule in calculus was used to determine the derivative of the composition of two \n      functions,\n      and in this section,\n      we will focus only on the composition of two functions.\n      We will then consider some results about the compositions of injections and surjections.\n     \n      The basic idea of function composition is that when possible,\n      the output of a function   is used as the input of a function  .\n      This can be referred to as\n        followed by  \n      and is called the composition of   and  .\n      In previous mathematics courses,\n      we used this idea to determine a formula for the composition of two real functions.\n     \n      For example, if\n       ,\n      then we can compute   as follows:\n       .\n     \n      In this case,  ,\n      the output of the function  ,\n      was used as the input for the function  .\n      We now give the formal definition of the composition of

bijection.\n               \n      In  ,\n      we explored some properties of composite functions related to injections,\n      surjections, and bijections.\n      The following theorem contains results that these explorations were intended to illustrate.\n      Some of the proofs will be included in the exercises.\n     \n          Let  ,\n           , and   be nonempty sets and assume that\n            and  .\n           \n               \n                If   and   are both injections,\n                then   is an injection.\n               \n             \n               \n                If   and   are both surjections,\n                then   is a surjection.\n               \n             \n               \n                If   and   are both bijections,\n                then   is a bijection.\n               \n             \n         \n      The proof of   is  .\n        is a direct consequence of the first two parts.\n      We will discuss a process for constructing a proof of  .\n      Using the forward-backward process,\n      we first look at the conclusion of the conditional statement in \n       .\n      The goal is to prove that   is a surjection.\n      Since  ,\n      this is equivalent to proving that\n\n     \n      For all  ,\n      there exists an   such that  .\n     \n\n      Since this statement in the backward process uses a universal quantifier,\n      we will use the choose-an-element method and choose an arbitrary element   in the \n      set  .\n      The goal now is to find an   such that  .\n     \n      Now we can look at the hypotheses.\n      In particular, we are assuming that both\n        and   are surjections.\n      Since we have chosen  ,\n      and   is a surjection, we know that\n\n     .\n\n      Now,   and   is a surjection.\n      Hence\n\n     .\n\n      If we now compute  , we will see that\n       .\n\n      We can now write the proof as follows:\n     Proof of  ,  \n      Let  ,\n       ,\n      and   be nonempty sets and assume that   and\n        are both surjections.\n      We will prove that   is a surjection.\n     \n      Let   be an arbitrary element of  .\n      We will prove there exists an   such that  .\n      Since   is a surjection, we conclude that\n     \n      there exists a   such that  .\n     \n      Now,   and   is a surjection.\n      Hence\n\n     .\n\n      We now see that\n\n       .\n     \n      We have now shown that for every  ,\n      there exists an   such that  ,\n      and this proves that   is a surjection.\n     \n       \n      shows us that if   and   are both special types of functions,\n      then the composition of   followed by   is also that type of function.\n      The next question is,\n       If the composition of   followed by   is an injection\n      (or surjection),\n      can we make any conclusions about   or  ? \n      A partial answer to this question is provided in  .\n      This theorem will be investigated and proved in the Explorations and Activities for this section.\n      See  .\n     \n          Let  ,\n           , and   be nonempty sets and assume that\n            and  .\n           \n               \n

where   and  .\n      That is,  .\n      See  Beginning Activity 2 \n      in  \n      for a more thorough discussion of this concept.\n     Beginning Activity 1: Functions and Sets of Ordered Pairs \n        When we graph a real function,\n        we plot ordered pairs in the Cartesian plane where the first coordinate is the \n        input of the function and the second coordinate is the output of the function.\n        For example, if  ,\n        then every point on the graph of   is an ordered pair\n          of real numbers where  .\n        This shows how we can generate ordered pairs from a function.\n        It happens that we can do this with any function.\n        For example, let\n         .\n  \n        Define the function   by\n         .\n       \n        We can convert each of these to an ordered pair in\n          by using the input as the first coordinate and the output as the \n        second coordinate.\n        For example,   is converted to  ,\n          is converted to  ,\n        and   is converted to  .\n        So we can think of this function as a set of ordered pairs,\n        which is a subset of  , and write\n         .\n       \n        Note: Since   is the name of the function,\n        it is customary to use   as the name for the set of ordered pairs.\n       \n              Let   and let  .\n              Define the function   by  ,\n               , and  .\n              Write the function   as a set of ordered pairs in  .\n             \n        For another example, if we have a real function,\n        such as   by  ,\n        then we can think of   as the following infinite subset of \n         :\n         .\n\n        We can also write this as  .\n       \n              Let   be defined by\n               , for all  .\n              Use set builder notation to write the function   as a set of ordered pairs,\n              and then use the roster method to write the function   as a set of ordered pairs.\n             \n        So any function   can be thought of as a set of ordered pairs that is a \n        subset of  .\n        This subset is\n         .\n\n        On the other hand,\n        if we started with  ,\n         , and\n         ,\n        then we could think of   as a function from   to   with \n         ,\n         , and  .\n        The idea is to use the first coordinate of each ordered pair as the input,\n        and the second coordinate as the output.\n        However, not every subset of\n          can be used to define a function from   to  .\n        This is explored in the following questions.\n       \n              Let  .\n              Could this set of ordered pairs be used to define a function from   to  ?\n              Explain.\n             \n              Let  .\n

example of a function   that is a bijection.\n              Draw an arrow diagram for this function.\n             \n              On your arrow diagram,\n              draw an arrow from each element

about these tables of values?\n             The Ordered Pair Representation of a Function function as set of ordered pairs \n          \n      In  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n      we observed that if we have a function  ,\n      we can generate a set of ordered pairs   that is a subset of   as follows:\n       .\n     \n      However, we also learned that some sets of ordered pairs cannot be used to define a function.\n      We now wish to explore under what conditions a set of ordered pairs can be used to define a function.\n      Starting with a function  ,\n      since  , we know that\n       .\n     \n      Specifically, we use  .\n      This says that every element of   can be used as an input.\n      In addition, to be a function,\n      each input can produce only one output.\n      In terms of ordered pairs,\n      this means that there will never be two ordered pairs   and\n        in the function   where  ,  , and  .\n      We can formulate this as a conditional statement as follows:\n       \n     \n      This also means that if we start with a subset   of\n        that satisfies conditions   and \n       ,\n      then we can consider   to be a function from   to   by using\n        whenever   is in  .\n      This proves the following theorem.\n     \n          Let   and   be nonempty sets and let   be a subset of\n            that satisfies the following two properties:\n           \n               \n                For every  ,\n                there exists   such that  ; and\n               \n             \n               \n                For every

\n      A Note about  .\n      The first condition in  \n      means that every element of   is an input,\n      and the second condition ensures that every input has exactly one output.\n      Many texts will use  \n      as the definition of a function.\n      Many mathematicians believe that this ordered pair representation of a function is the \n      most rigorous definition of a function.\n      It allows us to use set theory to work with and compare functions.\n      For example,\n      equality of functions becomes a question of equality of sets.\n      Therefore, many textbooks will use the ordered pair representation of a function as the \n      definition of a function.\n     Sets of Ordered Pairs that Are Not Functions \n        Let   and let  .\n        Explain why each of the following subsets of\n          cannot be used to define a function from   to  .\n       \n               .\n             \n                The set   does not satisfy the first condition of \n                 .\n               \n               .\n             \n                The set   does not satisfy the second condition of \n                 .\n               The Inverse of a Function \n      In previous mathematics courses,\n      we learned that the exponential function\n      (with base  )\n      and the natural logarithm function are inverses of each other.\n      This was often expressed as follows:\n       .\n     \n      Notice that this means that   is the input and   is the output for the \n      natural logarithm function if and only if   is the input and   is the \n      output for the exponential function.\n      In essence, the inverse function\n      (in this case, the exponential function)\n      reverses the action of the original function\n      (in this case, the natural logarithm function).\n      In terms of ordered pairs (input-output pairs),\n      this means that if   is an ordered pair for a function,\n      then   is an ordered pair for its inverse.\n      This idea of reversing the roles of the first and second coordinates is the basis for \n      our definition of the inverse of a function.\n     Definition inverse of a function

function.\n            Use your existing arrow diagram from   to draw this arrow diagram.\n           \n            Make a conjecture about what conditions on a function\n              will ensure that its inverse is a function from   to  .\n           \n              In order for the inverse of a function\n                to be a function from   to  ,\n              the function   must be a bijection.\n             \n      We will now consider a general argument suggested by the explorations in \n       .\n      By definition, if   is a function,\n      then   is a subset of  .\n      However,   may or may not be a function from   to  .\n      For example, suppose that   with   and  .\n      This is represented in  .\n     The Inverse Is Not a Function \n      In this case, if we try to reverse the arrows,\n      we will not get a function from   to  .\n      This is because   and   \n      with  .\n      Consequently,   is not a function.\n      This suggests that when   is not an injection,\n      then   is not a function.\n     \n      Also, if   is not a surjection,\n      then there exists a   such that\n        for all  ,\n      as in the diagram in  .\n      In other words,\n      there is no ordered pair in   with   as the second coordinate.\n      This means that there would be no ordered pair in\n        with   as a first coordinate.\n      Consequently,\n        cannot be a function from   to  .\n     \n      This motivates the statement in  .\n      In the proof of this theorem,\n      we will frequently change back and forth from the input-output representation of a function and the ordered pair representation of a function.\n      The idea is that if   is a function,\n      then for   and  ,\n       .\n     \n      When we use the ordered pair representation of a function,\n      we will also use the ordered pair representation of its inverse.\n      In this case, we know that\n       .\n     \n          Let   and   be nonempty sets and let  .\n          The inverse of   is a function from   to   if and only if \n            is a bijection.\n         \n        Let   and   be nonempty sets and let  .\n        We will first assume that   is a bijection and prove that\n          is a function from   to  .\n        To do this, we will show that\n          satisfies the two conditions of  .\n       \n        We first choose  .\n        Since the function   is a surjection,\n        there exists an   such that  .\n        This implies that   and hence that  .\n        Thus, each element of   is the first coordinate of an ordered pair in  ,\n        and hence   satisfies the first condition of  .\n       \n        To prove that   satisfies the second condition of  ,\n        we must show that each element of   is the first coordinate of exactly one \n        ordered pair in  .\n        So let  ,   and assume that\n         .\n\n        This means that   and  .\n        We can then conclude that\n         .\n\n        But this means that  .\n        Since   is a bijection,\n        it is an injection, and we can conclude that  .\n        This proves that   is the first element of only one ordered pair in  .\n        Consequently, we have proved that\n          satisfies both conditions of  \n        and hence that   is a function from   to  .\n       \n        We now assume that   is a function from   to   and prove that   is a bijection.\n        First, to prove that   is an injection,\n        we assume that   and that  .\n        We wish to show that  .\n        If we let  , we can conclude that\n         .\n\n        But this means that\n         .\n\n        Since we have assumed that   is a function,\n        we can conclude that  .\n        Hence,   is an injection.\n       \n        Now to prove that   is a surjection,\n        we choose   and will show that there exists an   such \n        that  .\n        Since   is a function,\n          must be the first coordinate of some ordered pair in  .\n        Consequently, there exists an   such that\n         .\n \n        Now this implies that   and hence that  .\n        This proves that   is a surjection.\n        Since we have also proved that   is an injection,\n        we conclude that   is a bijection. \n       Inverse Function Notation invertible function \n          Let   and   be nonempty sets and let   be a

Theorems about Inverse Functions \n      The next two results in this section are two important theorems about inverse functions.\n      The first is actually a corollary of  .\n     \n          Let   and   be nonempty sets and let   be a bijection.\n          Then\n           \n               \n                For every   in  ,\n                 .\n               \n             \n               \n                For every   in  ,\n                 .\n               \n             \n         \n        Let   and   be nonempty sets and assume that   is a bijection.\n        So let   and let  .\n        By  ,\n        we can conclude that  .\n        Therefore,\n         .\n        Hence, for each  ,\n         .\n       \n        The proof that for each   in  ,\n          is  .\n         \n       \n        This example is a continuation of  .\n       \n          For the cubing function and the cube root function,\n          we have seen that For  ,\n            if and only if  .\n          Notice that\n           \n               \n                If we substitute   into the equation  ,\n                we obtain  .\n               \n             \n               \n                If we substitute   into the equation  ,\n                we obtain  .\n               \n             \n         \n          This is an illustration of  .\n          We can see this by using   defined by   and\n            defined by  .\n          Then   and  .\n          So for each  ,\n           \n \n         \n          Similarly, the equation   for each\n            can be obtained from the fact that for each  ,\n           .\n         \n      We will now consider the case where\n        and   are both bijections.\n      In this case,\n        and  .\n       \n      can be used to illustrate this situation.\n     Composition of Two Bijections \n      By  ,\n        is also a bijection.\n      Hence, by  ,\n        is a function and, in fact,\n       .\n      Notice that we can also form the composition of   followed by\n        to get  .\n       \n      helps illustrate the result of the next theorem.\n     \n          Let   and   be bijections.\n          Then   is a bijection and  .\n         \n        Let   and   be bijections.\n        Then   and  .\n        Hence,  .\n        Also, by  ,\n          is a bijection,\n        and hence  .\n        We will now prove that for each  ,\n         .\n       \n        Let  .\n        Since the function   is a surjection,\n        there exists a   such that\n         .\n       \n        Also, since   is a surjection,\n        there exists an   such that\n         .\n       \n        Now these two equations can be written in terms of the respective inverse functions as\n         \n       \n        Using equation   and equation  , \n        we see that\n         .\n       \n        Using equation   and equation   again,\n        we see that  .\n        However, in terms of the inverse function, this means that\n         .\n       \n        Comparing equation   and \n        equation  , we have shown that for all  ,\n       \n         .\n        This proves that  . \n       \n          Let   and  .\n         \n          Construct an example of a function\n            that is not a bijection.\n          Write the inverse of this function as a set of ordered pairs.\n          Is the inverse of   a function?\n          Explain.\n          If so, draw an arrow diagram for   and  .\n         \n          Construct an example of a function   that is a bijection.\n          Write the inverse of this function as a set of ordered pairs.\n          Is the inverse of   a function?\n          Explain.\n          If so, draw an arrow diagram for   and  .\n         \n          Let   .\n          Define    by defining     to be the following set of ordered pairs.\n           \n         \n          Draw an arrow diagram to represent the function  .\n          Is the function   a bijection?\n         \n          Write the inverse of   as a set of ordered pairs.\n          Is   a function?\n          Explain.\n         \n             \n           \n          Draw an arrow diagram for   using the arrow diagram from \n           .\n         \n          Compute   and\n            for each   in  .\n          What theorem does this illustrate?\n         \n            For each  ,  .

given a formula for the function  ,\n          it may be desirable to determine a formula for the function  .\n          This can sometimes be done,\n          while at other times it is very difficult or even impossible.\n          Let   be defined by  .\n          A graph of this function would suggest that this function is a bijection.\n         \n          Prove that the function   is an injection and a surjection.\n         \n          Let  .\n          One way to prove that   is a surjection is to set\n            and solve for  .\n          If this can be done, then we would know that there exists an\n            such that  .\n          For the function  ,\n          we are using   for the input and   for the output.\n          By solving for   in terms of  ,\n          we are attempting to write a formula where   is the input and   is \n          the output.\n          This formula represents the inverse function.\n         \n          Solve the equation   for  .\n

inverse function,\n          it is sometimes necessary to restrict the domain\n          (or the codomain)\n          of a function.\n         \n          Let   be defined by  .\n          Explain why the inverse of the function   is not a function.

Activity 2: Functions and Intervals \n        Let   be defined by  ,\n        for each  .\n       \n            We will first determine where   maps the closed interval  .\n            (Recall that  .)\n            That is, we will describe, in simpler terms,\n            the set  .\n            This is the set of all images of the real numbers in the closed interval \n             .\n

 Label the points   and   on the graph.\n               \n                Now draw horizontal lines from the points   and   to the  -axis.\n                Use this information from the graph to

intervals.\n                  Use interval notation or set builder notation.)\n                 Functions Acting on Sets \n      In our study of functions, we have focused on how a function\n       maps \n      individual elements of its domain to the codomain.\n      We also studied the preimage of an individual element in its codomain.\n      For example,\n      if   is defined by  ,\n      for each  , then\n       \n           \n             .\n            We say that   maps 2 to 4 or that 4 is the image of 2 under the function  .\n           \n         \n           \n            Since   implies that   or  ,\n            we say that the preimages of 4 are 2 and   or that the set of preimages of \n            4 is  .\n           \n         \n     \n      For a function  ,\n      the next step is to consider subsets of   or   and what corresponds to them in the other set.\n      We did this in the beginning activities.\n      We will give some definitions and then revisit the examples in the beginning activities in light of these definitions.\n      We will first consider the situation where   is a subset of   and consider the set of outputs whose inputs are from  .\n      This will be a subset of  .\n     Definition image of a set image of   under  the image of  \n      We now consider the situation in which   is a subset of   and consider the \n      subset of   consisting of all elements of   whose outputs are in  .\n     Definition preimage of a set inverse image of a set preimage of\n            under  the preimage of  inverse image of   under  \n      Notice that the set   is defined whether or not   is a function.\n     Beginning Activity 1  Revisited \n        Let   and  .\n        Define   by\n         .\n       \n        Let  .\n       \n

and answer the questions posed in each case.\n       \n           \n            The set   is a subset of   and so\n              is a subset of  .\n            In addition,\n              and   are subsets of  .\n            Hence,   is a subset of  .\n           \n           \n            Is there any relationship between\n              and  ?\n           \n         \n           \n            The set   is a subset of   and so\n              is a subset of  .\n            In addition,\n              and   are subsets of  .\n            Hence,   is a subset of  .\n           \n           \n            Is there any relationship between\n              and  ?\n           \n         \n           \n            The set   is a subset of   and so\n              is a subset of  .\n            In addition,   and\n              are subsets of  .\n            Hence,   is a subset of  .\n           \n           \n            Is there any relationship between the sets\n              and  ?\n           \n         \n           \n            The set   is a subset of   and so\n              is a subset of  .\n            In addition,   and\n              are subsets of  .\n            Hence,   is a

the next progress check.\n     Set Operations and Functions Acting on Sets \n        In  ,\n        we introduced functions involving congruences.\n        For example, if we let\n         ,\n        then we can define   by  ,\n        where   and  .\n        Moreover, we shortened this notation to\n         .\n       \n        We will use the following subsets of  :\n         .\n        \n       \n            Verify that  ,\n             ,  , and  .\n            Then determine  ,\n             ,  , and  .\n           \n               \n             \n            Determine  ,\n             ,  , and  .\n           \n                 \n                 \n               \n             \n            For each of the following,\n            determine the two subsets of   and then determine if there is a \n            relationship between the two sets.\n            For example,\n              and since  ,\n            we see that  .\n           \n                    and  \n                 \n                      and  . So in this case,\n                     .\n                   \n                    and  \n                 \n                      and \n                     . So in this case,\n                     .\n                   \n                    and  \n                 \n                     .\n                    So in this case,\n                     .\n                   \n                    and  \n                 \n                     .\n                    So in this case,\n                     .\n                   \n            Notice that   is a

 \n               .\n              Hence,  .\n              So in this case,\n               .\n             \n            Notice that   is a subset of the domain,\n             .\n            Consequently,\n              is a subset of the codomain,\n             .\n            Is there any relation between   and   in this case?\n           \n               .\n              So  .\n              So in this case,\n               .\n             Set Operations and Functions Acting on Sets \n          Define   by\n            for all  .\n          It will be helpful to use the graph shown

Recall that  .\n              Notice   is a subset of the codomain,\n               .\n              Explain why  .\n              Since   is a subset of the domain,\n               , we see that in

      We start by letting   be an element of  .\n        This means that   is an element of  .\n        Hence,\n         .\n\n        In the case where  ,\n        we conclude that  ,\n        and

\n      This idea of relating the elements of one set to those of another set using ordered \n      pairs is not restricted to functions.\n      For example, we may say that one integer,  ,\n      is related to another integer,  ,\n      provided that   is congruent to   modulo 3.\n      Notice that this relation of congruence modulo 3 provides a way of relating one integer \n      to another integer.\n      However, in this case,\n      an integer   is related to more than one other integer.\n      For example, since\n       ,\n      we can say that 5 is related to 5, 5 is related to 2, and 5 is related to  .\n      Notice that, as with functions,\n      each relation of the form   involves two integers   and \n        and hence involves an ordered pair  ,\n      which is an element of  .\n     Definition relation relation  R  from the set  \n          to the set  R relation on the set  \n      In  ,\n      we defined the domain and range of a function.\n      We make similar definitions for a relation.\n     Definition domain of a relation relation domain range of a relation relation range domain range \n          We use the notation   for the domain of   and\n            for the range of  .\n          So using set builder notation,\n           .\n         Domain and Range \n          A relation was studied in each of the beginning activities for this section.\n          For  Beginning Activity 2 ,\n          the set   \n          is a subset of   and, hence,\n            is a relation on  .\n          In   of \n           Beginning Activity 2 ,\n          we actually determined the domain and range of this relation.\n           \n         \n          So from the results in  Beginning Activity 2 ,\n          we can say that the domain of the relation   is the closed interval\n            and the range of   is the closed interval \n           .\n         \n            Let  .\n           \n                  Explain why   is a relation on  .\n

          If we assume that each state except Hawaii has a land border in common with itself,\n                then the domain and range of   are the set of all states except Hawaii.\n                If we do not make this assumption,\n                then the domain and range are the set of all states except Hawaii and Alaska.\n               \n          Are the following statements true or

second statement is false.\n                Following is a counterexample:\n                 ,\n                 ,\n                but  .\n               Some Standard Mathematical Relations \n      There are many different relations in mathematics.\n      For example,\n      two real numbers can be considered to be related if one number is less than the other number.\n      We call this the\n       less than \n      relation on  .\n      If   and   is less than  ,\n      we often write  .\n      As a set of ordered pairs, this relation is  , where\n       .\n     \n      With many mathematical relations,\n      we do not write the relation as a set of ordered pairs even though,\n      technically, it is a set of ordered pairs.\n       \n      describes some standard mathematical relations.\n     Standard Mathematical Relations Name Open \n                  Sentence Relation as a Set of \n                 Ordered Pairs The\n             less than \n

related to  \n      The mathematical relations in  \n      all used a relation symbol between the two elements that form the ordered pair in \n       .\n      For this reason,\n      we often do the same thing for a general relation from the set   to the set  .\n      So if   is a relation from   to  ,\n      and   and  , we use the notation\n  \n\n     .\n\n  \n      In some cases,\n      we will even use a generic relation symbol for defining a new relation or speaking about \n      relations in a general context.\n      Perhaps the most commonly used symbol is\n       , read\n       tilde \n      or\n       squiggle \n      or\n       is related to. \n      When we do this, we will write\n    \n     .\n\n     The Divides Relation divides relation divides \n        Whenever we have spoken about one integer dividing another integer,\n        we have worked with the\n         divides \n            \n        relation on  .\n        In particular, we can write\n         .\n       \n        In this case, we have a specific notation for\n         divides, \n        and we write  .\n       \n            What is the domain of the\n             divides \n            relation?\n            What is the range of the\n             divides \n            relation?\n           \n              The domain of the divides relation is the set of all nonzero integers.\n              The range of the divides relation is the set of all integers.\n             \n            Are the following statements true or false?\n            Explain.\n           \n                For every nonzero integer  ,  .\n               \n                  This statement is true since for each\n                   ,  .\n                 \n                For all nonzero integers   and  ,\n                if  , then  .\n               \n                  This statement is false: For example, 2 divides 4 but 4 does not divide 2.\n                 \n                For all nonzero integers  ,  , and  ,\n                if   and  , then  .\n               \n                  This statement is true by  .\n                 Functions as Relations \n      If we have a function  ,\n      we can generate a set of ordered pairs   that is a subset of   as follows:\n       .\n     \n      This means that   is a relation from   to  .\n      Since,  , we know that\n       .\n      \n     \n      When  ,\n      we write  .\n      In addition, to be a function,\n      each input can produce only one output.\n      In terms of ordered pairs,\n      this means that there will never be two ordered pairs   and\n        in the function  ,\n      where  ,  , and  .\n      We can formulate this as a conditional statement as follows:\n       .\n      \n     \n      This means that a function   from   to

Not every relation,\n      however, will be a function.\n      For example,\n      consider the relation   in  .\n       \n     \n      This relation fails condition (2) above since a counterexample \n      comes from the facts that\n        and   and  .\n     A Set of Ordered Pairs \n        Let  .\n        The set   can then be considered to be relation on   since it is a \n        subset of  .\n       \n            List five different ordered pairs that are in the set  .\n           \n              Each element in the set   is an ordered pair of the form   \n              where  .\n             \n            Use the roster method to specify the elements of each of the following the sets:\n           \n                 \n               \n                   \n                 \n                 \n               \n                   \n                 \n                 \n               \n                   \n                 \n                 \n               \n                   \n                 \n            Since each real number   produces only one value of   for which  ,\n            the set   can be used to define a function from the set   to  .\n            Draw a graph of this function.\n           \n              The graph of   is a parabola with vertex at the origin that is concave up.\n             Visual Representations of Relations \n      In  ,\n      we were able to draw a graph of a relation as a way to visualize the relation.\n      In this case,\n      the relation was a function from   to  .\n      In addition,\n      in  ,\n      we were also able to use a graph to represent a relation.\n      In this case, the graph of the relation\n        \n      is a circle of radius 8 whose center is at the origin.\n     \n      When   is a relation from a subset of the real numbers   to a subset of \n       ,\n      we can often use a graph to provide a visual representation of the relation.\n      This is especially true if the relation is defined by an equation or even an inequality.\n      For example, if\n       ,\n      then we can use the following graph as a way to visualize the points in the plane that \n      are also in this relation.\n     Graph of  Graph of a parabola opening up with vertex at the origin. The area above the \n      curve is shaded.\n           \n      The points   in the relation   are the points on the graph of \n        or are in the shaded region.\n      This because for these points,  .\n      One of the shortcomings of this type of graph is that the graph of the equation and the \n      shaded region are actually unbounded and so we can never show the entire graph of this relation.\n      However, it does allow us to see that the points in this relation are either on the \n      parabola defined by the equation   or are\n       inside \n      the parabola.\n     directed graph digraph Directed Graph for a Relation vertices vertex directed edges The Directed Graph of a Relation \n        Let  .\n        Draw a directed graph for the following two relations on the set  .\n        For each relation,\n        it may be helpful to arrange the vertices of   as shown in  .\n         .\n       Vertices for  \n          The directed graph for   is on the left and the directed graph for   \n          is on the right.\n           \n         \n         \n          Let  ,\n           ,\n          and let   be the set of ordered pairs defined by \n           .\n         \n          Use the roster method to list all the elements of  .\n          Explain why   can be considered to be a relation from   to \n           .\n         \n            The set   contains nine ordered pairs.

Consequently, we can talk about one relation \n          being a subset of another relation. Another thing to remember is that the elements of \n          a relation are ordered pairs.\n         The Inverse of a Relation inverse of a function function inverse of \n          In  ,\n          we introduced the  inverse of a function .\n            \n            If   and   are nonempty sets and if   is a function, \n            then the inverse of   , denoted by   , is defined as\n           .\n          Now that we know about relations,\n          we see that     is always a relation from     to  .\n          The concept of the inverse of a function is actually a special case of the more \n          general concept of the inverse of a relation,\n          which we now define.\n         Definition inverse of a relation relation inverse of inverse of  \n              That is,   is the subset of\n                consisting of all ordered pairs\n                such that  .\n             \n          For example, let   be the\n           divides \n          relation on   .  See  . So\n           .\n          This means that we can write   if and only if  . So, in this case,\n           .\n          Now, if we would like to focus on the first coordinate instead of the second \n          coordinate in  , we know that\n             divides   \n          means the same thing as\n             is a multiple of   . \n          Hence,\n           .\n         \n          We can say that the inverse of the\n           divides \n          relation on     is the\n           is a multiple of \n          relation on   .  , which \n          follows, contains some elementary facts about inverse relations.\n         \n              Let   be a relation from the set   to the set  .\n              Then\n               \n                   \n                    The domain of   is the range of  .\n                    That is,  .\n                   \n                 \n                   \n                    The range of   is the domain of  .\n                    That is,  .\n                   \n                 \n                   \n                    The inverse of   is  .\n                    That is,  .\n                   \n                 \n             \n          To prove the first part of  , observe that the \n          goal is to prove that two sets are equal,\n           .\n          One way to do this is to prove that each is a subset of the other. To prove that \n           , \n          we can start by choosing an arbitrary element of \n           .  So let \n           .  The goal now is to prove \n          that  .

satisfies certain properties,\n        we often ask if other things satisfy the same properties.\n        Before investigating this, we will give names to these properties.\n       Definition reflexive on  symmetric transitive \n        Before exploring examples, for each of these properties,\n        it is a good idea to understand what it means to say that a relation does not satisfy \n        the property.\n        So let   be a nonempty set and let   be a relation on  .\n       \n              Carefully explain what it means to say that the relation   is not reflexive on the set

     \n           Directed Graphs and Properties of Relations \n      In  , we used directed graphs,\n      or digraphs, to represent relations on finite sets.\n      Three properties of relations were introduced in \n       Beginning Activity 1 \n      and will be repeated in the following descriptions of how these properties can be \n      visualized on a directed graph.\n     reflexive on  symmetric transitive Properties of Relations \n        Let   and let   be the following relation on  :\n         .\n       \n        Draw a directed graph for the relation   and then determine if the relation \n          is reflexive on  ,\n        if the relation   is symmetric,\n        and if the relation   is transitive.\n       \n          The relation  :\n           \n                \n                Is not reflexive since   and  .\n               \n             \n               \n                Is symmetric.\n               \n             \n               \n                Is not transitive.\n                For example,  ,\n                 , but  .\n               \n             \n         Definition of an Equivalence Relation \n      In mathematics, as in real life,\n      it is often convenient to think of two different things as being essentially the same.\n      For example, when you go to a store to buy a cold soft drink,\n      the cans of soft drinks in the cooler are often sorted by brand and type of soft drink.\n      The Coca Colas are grouped together,\n      the Pepsi Colas are grouped together, the Dr.\n      Peppers are grouped together, and so on.\n      When we choose a particular can of one type of soft drink,\n      we are assuming that all the cans are essentially the same.\n      Even though the specific cans of one type of soft drink are physically different,\n      it makes no difference which can we choose.\n      In doing this,\n      we are saying that the cans of one type of soft drink are equivalent,\n      and we are using the mathematical notion of an equivalence relation.\n     \n      An equivalence relation on a set is a relation with a certain combination of properties \n      that allow us to sort the elements of the set into certain classes.\n      In this section,\n      we will focus on the properties that define an equivalence relation,\n      and in the next section,\n      we will see how these properties allow us to sort or partition the elements of the set \n      into certain classes.\n     Definition equivalence relation relation equivalence equivalence relation is equivalent to  \n      Most of the examples we have studied so far have involved a relation on a small finite set.\n      For these examples,\n      it was convenient to use a directed graph to represent the relation.\n      It is now time to look at some other type of examples,\n      which may prove to be more interesting.\n      In these examples,\n      keep in mind that there is a subtle difference between the reflexive property and the \n      other two properties.\n      The reflexive property states that some ordered pairs actually belong to the relation  ,\n      or some elements of   are related.\n      The reflexive property has a universal quantifier and, hence,\n      we must prove that for all  ,  .\n      Symmetry and transitivity,\n      on the other hand, are defined by conditional sentences.\n      We often use a direct proof for these properties,\n      and so we start by assuming the hypothesis and then showing that the conclusion must \n      follow from the hypothesis.\n     A Relation that Is Not an Equivalence Relation \n          Let   be the relation on   defined as follows:\n           \n            For  ,   if and only if   \n            is a multiple of  .\n           \n         \n          So   if and only if there exists a\n            such that  .\n           \n               \n                The relation   is reflexive on\n                  since for each  ,\n                  and, hence,  .\n               \n             \n               \n                Notice that  ,\n                but  .\n                So there exist integers   and   such that\n                  but  .\n                Hence, the relation   is not symmetric.\n               \n             \n               \n                Now assume that    and   .\n                Then there exist integers     and     such that\n                 .\n                Using the second equation to make a substitution in the first equation,\n                we see that  .\n                Since   ,\n                we have shown that     is a multiple of    and hence   .\n                Therefore,     is a transitive relation.\n               \n             \n         \n      The relation   is reflexive on   and is transitive,\n      but since   is not symmetric,\n      it is not an equivalence relation on  .\n     A Relation that Is an Equivalence Relation \n        Define the relation   on   as follows: For all  ,\n          if and only if  .\n        For example:\n         \n             \n                since\n                and  .\n             \n           \n             \n                since\n                and  .\n             \n           \n       \n        To prove that   is reflexive on  ,\n        we note that for all  ,  .\n        Since  , we conclude that  .\n        Now prove that the relation   is symmetric and transitive,\n        and hence,\n        that   is an equivalence relation on  .\n       \n          Proof that the relation   is symmetric: Let\n            and assume that  .\n          This means that  .\n          Therefore,   and this means that  ,\n          and hence,  .\n         \n          Proof that the relation   is transitive: Let\n            and assume that   and  .\n          This means that   and that  .\n          Therefore,   and this means that \n           ,\n          and hence,  .\n         Congruence Modulo  congruence \n      One of the important equivalence relations we will study in detail is that of congruence\n          \n      modulo  .\n      We reviewed this relation in  Beginning Activity 2 .\n     \n       \n      tells us that congruence modulo   is an equivalence relation on  .\n      Recall that by the Division Algorithm,\n      if  ,\n      then there exist unique integers   and   such that\n       .\n     \n       \n      and  \n      then tell us that  .\n      That is,   is congruent modulo   to its remainder   when it is \n      divided by  .\n      When we use the term\n       remainder \n      in this context, we always mean the remainder   with\n        that is guaranteed by the Division Algorithm.\n      We can use this idea to prove the following theorem.\n     \n          Let   and let  .\n          Then   if and only if   and   have the same \n          remainder when divided by  .\n         \n        Let   and let  .\n        We will first prove that if   and   have the same remainder when divided \n        by  ,\n        then  .\n        So assume that   and   have the same remainder when divided by  ,\n        and let   be this common remainder.\n        Then, by  ,\n         .\n\n        Since congruence modulo   is an equivalence relation,\n        it is a symmetric relation.\n        Hence, since  ,\n        we can conclude that  .\n        Combining this with the fact that  ,\n        we now have\n         .\n\n        We can now use the transitive property to conclude that  .\n        This proves that if   and   have the same remainder when divided by  , then\n         .\n       \n        We will now prove that if  ,\n        then   and   have the same remainder when divided by  .\n        Assume that  ,\n        and let   be the least nonnegative remainder when   is divided by  .\n        Then   and,\n        by  ,\n         .\n\n        Now, using the facts that   and  ,\n        we can use the transitive property to conclude that\n         .\n\n        This means that there exists an integer   such that   or that\n         .\n\n        Since we already know that  ,\n        the last equation tells us that   is the least nonnegative remainder when \n          is divided by  .\n        Hence we have proven that if  ,\n        then   and   have the same remainder when divided by  . \n       Examples of Other Equivalence Relations equality relation relation equality identity relation relation identity \n         \n          The relation   on   from   \n          is an equivalence relation.\n         \n       \n         equality

that  .\n           \n         \n         \n        We will prove that the relation   is an equivalence relation on  .\n        The relation     is reflexive on\n          since for each   ,\n         .\n         \n         \n        Now, let    and assume that   .\n        We will prove that   .\n        Since   , there exists an integer     such that\n         .\n        By multiplying both sides of this equation by  ,\n        we obtain\n         .\n\n        Since   ,\n        the last equation proves that   .\n        Hence, we have proven that if   ,\n        then    and,\n        therefore, the relation     is symmetric.\n         \n         \n        To prove transitivity, let\n          and assume that    and  .\n        We will prove that   .\n        Now, there exist integers     and     such that\n         .\n        By adding the corresponding sides of these two equations,\n        we see that\n         \n\n        By the closure properties of the integers,\n         .\n        So this proves that   and,\n        hence the relation     is transitive.\n         \n         \n        We have now proven that     is an equivalence relation on   .\n        This equivalence relation is important in trigonometry.\n        If    ,\n        then there exists an integer     such that    and,\n        hence,   .\n        Since the sine and cosine functions are

\n       Another Equivalence Relation \n        Let   be a finite,\n        nonempty set and let   be the power set of  .\n        Recall that   consists of all subsets of  .\n        (See  Definition

   Therefore, the relation   is an equivalence relation on \n           .\n         \n          Let   and let \n           .\n          Is   an equivalence relation on  ?\n          If not, is

However, \n          it is transitive since the conditional statement\n           For all  , if   and  , \n          then  \n          is a true conditional statement since the hypothesis will always be false.\n         \n          Let  .\n          For each of the following,\n          draw a directed graph that represents a relation with the specified properties.\n         \n          A relation on   that is symmetric but not transitive\n         \n          A relation on   that is transitive but not symmetric\n         \n          A relation on   that is symmetric and transitive but not reflexive on  \n         \n          A relation on   that is not reflexive on  ,\n          is not symmetric, and is not transitive\n         \n          A relation on  , other than the identity relation,\n          that is an equivalence relation on  \n         \n          Let   .\n          The identity relation on     is\n           .\n          Determine an equivalence relation on     that is different from    \n          or explain why this is not possible.\n         \n          There are many possible equivalence relations on this set. Perhaps one of the easier \n          ways to determine one is to first decide what elements will be equivalent. For example, \n          suppose we say that we want 1 and 2 to be equivalent (and of course, all elements will \n          be equivalent to themselves). So if we use the symbol   for the equivalence \n          relation, then we need   and  . Using set notation, we can \n          write this equivalence relation as\n           .\n         \n          Let  .\n          Then   is a relation on  .\n          Is   an equivalence relation on  ?\n          If not, is   reflexive, symmetric, or transitive?\n          Justify all conclusions.\n         \n          The relation   is not reflexive on  .

For example,  ,\n           , and  .\n          The relation   is not an equivalence relation.\n         \n          A relation   is defined on   as follows: For all  ,\n            if and only if  .\n          Is   an equivalence relation on  ?\n          If not, is   reflexive, symmetric, or transitive?\n          Justify all conclusions.\n         \n          Let    be defined by\n            for each   .\n          Define a relation     on    as follows:\n           .\n         \n          Is the relation   an equivalence relation on  ?\n          Justify your conclusion.\n         \n            The relation   is an equivalence relation.\n            For  ,   since  .

combination of \n        properties (reflexive,\n        symmetric,\n        and transitive) that allow us to sort the elements of the set into certain classes.\n        This is done by means of certain subsets of   that are associated with the e\n        lements of the set  .\n        This will be illustrated with the following example.\n        Let  ,\n        and let   be the relation on the set   defined as follows:\n         \n       \n        For each  ,\n        define the subset   of   as follows:\n         .\n \n        That is,   consists of those elements in   such that  .\n

an equivalence relation.\n        The following example will show how different this can be for a relation that is not \n        an equivalence relation.\n       \n        Let  ,\n        and let   be

      An important equivalence relation that we have studied is congruence modulo   \n        on the integers.\n        We can also define subsets of the integers based on congruence modulo  .\n        We will illustrate this with congruence modulo 3.\n        For example,\n        we can define   to be the set of all integers   that are congruent to \n        0 modulo 3.\n        That is,\n         .\n       \n        Since an integer   is congruent to 0 modulo 3 if and only if 3 divides  ,\n        we can use the roster method to specify this set as follows:\n         .\n       \n            Use the roster method to specify each of the following sets:\n           \n                The set   of all integers   that are congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n                That is,  .\n               \n                The set   of all integers   that are congruent to 2 modulo 3.\n                That is,  .\n               \n                The set   of all integers   that are congruent to 3 modulo 3.\n                That is,  .\n               \n            Now consider the three sets,  ,\n             , and  .\n           \n                  Determine the intersection of any two of these sets.\n                  That is, determine  ,\n                   , and  .\n                 \n                  Let  .\n                  What is the remainder when   is divided by 3?\n                  Which of the three sets, if any, contains  ?\n                 \n                  Repeat   for   and for \n                   .\n                 \n                  Do you think that  ?\n                  Explain.\n                 \n                  Is the set   equal to one of the sets  ,\n                  or  ?\n                 \n                  We can also define  .\n                  Is this set equal to any of the previous sets we have studied in this part?\n                  Explain.\n                 The Definition of an Equivalence Class \n      We have indicated that an equivalence relation on a set is a relation with a certain \n      combination of properties (reflexive,\n      symmetric,\n      and transitive) that allow us to sort the elements of the set into certain classes.\n      We saw this happen in the beginning  activities.\n      We can now illustrate specifically what this means.\n      For example,\n      in  Beginning Activity 2 ,\n      we used the equivalence relation of congruence modulo 3 on\n        to construct the following three sets:\n       .\n     \n      The main results that we want to use now are  \n      and  .\n      This corollary tells us that for any  ,\n        is congruent to precisely one of the integers 0, 1, or 2.\n      Consequently,\n      the integer   must be congruent to 0, 1, or 2, and it cannot be congruent to two of these numbers.\n      Thus\n       \n           \n            For each  ,\n             ,  ,\n            or  ; and\n           \n         \n           \n             ,\n              , and  .\n           \n         \n     \n      This means that the relation of congruence modulo 3 sorts the integers into three \n      distinct sets,\n      or classes,\n      and that each pair of these sets have no elements in common.\n      So if we use a rectangle to represent  ,\n      we can divide that rectangle into three smaller rectangles,\n      corresponding to  ,  ,\n      and  , and we might picture this situation as follows:\n     The Integers  consisting \n          of all integers with a  \n         remainder of 0 when   divided by 3  consisting \n          of all integers with a  \n         remainder of 1 when   divided by 3  consisting \n          of all integers with a  \n         remainder of 2 when   divided by 3 \n      Each integer is in exactly one of the three sets  ,\n       , or  ,\n      and two integers are congruent modulo 3 if and only if they are in the same set.\n      We will see that, in a similar manner,\n      if   is any natural number,\n      then the relation of congruence modulo   can be used to sort the integers into   classes.\n      We will also see that in general,\n      if we have an equivalence relation   on a set  ,\n      we can sort the elements of the set   into classes in a similar manner.\n     Definition equivalence class equivalence class of  \n          We read   as\n           the equivalence class of  \n          or as\n           bracket  . \n         Notes \n       \n           \n            We use the notation   when only one equivalence relation is being used.\n            If there is more than one equivalence relation,\n            then we need to distinguish between the equivalence classes for each relation.\n            We often use something like  ,\n            or if   is the name of the relation,\n            we can use   or   for the equivalence class of   \n            determined by  .\n            In any case,\n            always remember that when we are working with any equivalence relation on a set \n              if  ,\n            then  the equivalence class   is a subset of  . \n           \n         \n           \n            We know that each integer has an equivalence class for the equivalence relation of \n            congruence modulo 3.\n            But as we have seen, there are really only three\n             distinct  equivalence classes.\n            Using the notation from the definition, they are:\n             .\n           \n         \n       Equivalence Classes from  Beginning Activity 1 \n        Without using the terminology at that time,\n        we actually determined the equivalence classes of the equivalence relation \n          in  Beginning Activity 1 .\n        What are the distinct equivalence classes for this equivalence relation?\n       \n          The distinct equivalence classes for the relation   are:\n            and  .\n         Congruence Modulo   and Congruence Classes \n      In  Beginning Activity 2 ,\n      we used the notation   for the set of all integers that are congruent to \n        modulo 3.\n      We could have used a similar notation for equivalence classes,\n      and this would have been perfectly acceptable.\n      However, the notation   is probably the most common notation for the \n      equivalence class of  .\n      We will now use this same notation when dealing with congruence modulo   \n      when only one congruence relation is under consideration.\n     Definition congruence class \n       congruence class of  \n        \n          Let  .\n          Congruence modulo   is an equivalence relation on  .\n          So for  ,\n           .\n         congruence class of   modulo  \n      We have seen that congruence modulo 3 divides the integers into three distinct \n      congruence classes.\n      Each congruence class consists of those integers with the same remainder when divided by 3.\n      In a similar manner,\n      if we use congruence modulo 2, we simply divide the integers into two classes.\n      One class will consist of all the integers that have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, \n      and the other class will consist of all the integers that have a remainder of 1 when \n      divided by 2.\n      That is, congruence modulo 2 simply divides the integers into the even and odd integers.\n     Congruence Modulo 4 \n        Determine all of the distinct congruence classes for the equivalence relation of \n        congruence modulo 4 on the integers.\n        Specify each congruence class using the roster method.\n       \n          The distinct congruence classes for congruence modulo 4 are\n           .\n         Properties of Equivalence Classes \n      As we have seen,\n      in  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n      the relation   was an equivalence relation.\n      For that activity,\n      we used   to denote the equivalence class of  ,\n      and we observed that these equivalence classes were either equal or disjoint.\n     \n      However, in  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n      the relation   was not an equivalence relation,\n      and hence we do not use the term\n       equivalence class \n      for this relation.\n      We should note, however,\n      that the sets   were not equal and were not disjoint.\n      This exhibits one of the main distinctions between equivalence relations and relations \n      that are not equivalence relations.\n     \n     equivalence class properties of \n      In  ,\n      we will prove that if   is an equivalence relation on the set  ,\n      then we can\n       sort \n      the elements of   into distinct equivalence classes.\n      The properties of equivalence classes that we will prove are as follows:\n        \n      (1) Every element of \n        is in its own equivalence class; \n      (2) two elements are equivalent if and only if their equivalence classes are equal;\n      and (3) two equivalence classes are either identical or they are disjoint.\n     \n          Let   be a nonempty set and let   be an equivalence relation on the \n          set  .\n          Then,\n           \n               \n                For each  ,  .\n               \n

          \n             \n         \n        Let   be a nonempty set and assume that   is an equivalence relation \n        on  .\n        To prove the first part of the theorem, let  .\n        Since   is an equivalence relation on  ,\n        it is reflexive on  .\n        Thus,  , and we can conclude that  .\n       \n        The second part of this theorem is a biconditional statement.\n        We will prove it by proving two conditional statements.\n        We will first prove that if  ,\n        then  .\n        So let   and assume that  .\n        We will now prove that the two sets   and   are equal.\n        We will do this by proving that each is a subset of the other.\n       \n        First, assume that  .\n        Then, by definition,  .\n        Since we have assumed that  ,\n        we can use the transitive property of   to conclude that  ,\n        and this means that  .\n        This proves that  .\n       \n        We now assume that  .\n        This means that  ,\n        and hence by the symmetric property, that  .\n        Again, we are assuming that  .\n        So we have   and  .\n        We use the transitive property to conclude that   and then,\n        using the symmetric property,\n        we conclude that  .\n        This proves that   and, hence,\n        that  .\n        This means that we can conclude that if  ,\n        then  .\n       \n        We must now prove that if  , then  .\n        Let   and assume that  .\n        Using the first part of the theorem,\n        we know that   and since the two sets are equal,\n        this tells us that  .\n        Hence by the definition of  ,\n        we conclude that  .\n        This completes the proof of the second part of the theorem.\n       \n        For the third part of the theorem, let  .\n        Since this part of the theorem is a disjunction,\n        we will consider two cases: Either\n         .\n       \n        In the case where  ,\n        the first part of the disjunction is true,\n        and hence there is nothing to prove.\n        So we assume that   and will show that \n         .\n        Since  ,\n        there is an element   in   such that\n         .\n       \n        This means that   and  .\n        Consequently,   and  ,\n        and so we can use the second part of the theorem to conclude that\n          and  .\n        Hence,  ,\n        and we have proven that   or  . \n       \n       \n      gives the primary properties of equivalence classes.\n      Consequences of these properties will be explored in the exercises.\n      The following table restates the properties in  \n      and gives a verbal description of each one.\n     Formal Statement from \n               Verbal Description For each   ,  . Every element of   is in its own   equivalence class. For each  ,   if and   only if\n           . Two elements of   are equivalent if \n               and only if their equivalence classes \n                are equal. For each  ,   or \n               . Any two equivalence classes are  \n         either equal or they are disjoint.  \n         This means that if two equivalence classes \n          are not disjoint then they   must be equal. Equivalence Classes \n        Let   be defined by\n          for each  .\n        Define a relation   on\n          as follows: For  ,\n          if and only if  .\n        In   of  ,\n        we

            \n                 \n               \n      The results of  \n      are consistent with all the equivalence relations studied in the beginning activities \n      and in the progress checks.\n      Since this theorem applies to all equivalence relations,\n      it applies to the relation of congruence modulo   on the integers.\n      Because of the importance of this equivalence relation,\n      these results for congruence modulo   are given in the following corollary.\n     \n          Let  .\n          For each  ,\n          let   represent the congruence class of   modulo  .\n           \n               \n                For each  ,  .\n               \n             \n               \n                For each  ,\n                  if and only if  .\n               \n             \n               \n                For each  ,\n                  or  .\n               \n             \n         \n      For the equivalence relation of congruence modulo  ,\n       \n      and  \n      tell us that each integer is congruent to its remainder when divided by  ,\n      and that each integer is congruent modulo   to precisely one of one of the integers \n       .\n      This means that each integer is in precisely one of the congruence classes  ,\n       ,\n       .\n      Hence,  \n      gives us the following result.\n     \n          Let  .\n          For each

partitions and equivalence classes since the \n      equivalence classes of an equivalence relation form a partition of the underlying set,\n      as will be proven in  .\n      The proof of this theorem relies on the results in  .\n     \n          Let   be an equivalence relation on the nonempty set  .\n          Then the collection   of all equivalence classes determined by \n            is a partition of the set  .\n         \n        Let   be an equivalence relation on the nonempty set  ,\n        and let   be the collection of all equivalence classes determined by  .\n        That is,\n         .\n\n        We will use  \n        to prove that   is a partition of  .\n       \n          of  \n        states that for each  ,  .\n        In terms of the equivalence classes,\n        this means that each equivalence class is nonempty since each element of   \n        is in its own equivalence class.\n        Consequently,  ,\n        the collection of all equivalence classes determined by  ,\n        satisfies the first two conditions of the definition of a partition.\n       \n        We must now show that the collection\n          of all equivalence classes determined by   satisfies the \n        third condition for being a partition.\n        That is, we need to show that any two equivalence classes are either equal or are disjoint.\n        However, this is exactly the result in   of \n         .\n       \n        Hence, we have proven that the collection\n          of all equivalence classes determined by   is a partition \n        of the set  . \n       \n      Note:  \n      has shown us that if   is an equivalence relation on a nonempty set  ,\n      then the collection of the equivalence classes determined by   form a \n      partition of the set  .\n     \n      This process can be reversed.\n      This means that given a partition\n        of a nonempty set  ,\n      we can define an equivalence relation on   whose equivalence classes are precisely \n      the subsets of   that form the partition.\n      This will be explored in  .\n     \n          Let   and let   be the relation on \n            that is represented by the directed

situation,\n      we refer to the equivalence classes as congruence classes.\n     Definition integers modulo  integers modulo  \n        tells us that\n       .\n\n      In addition,\n      we know that each integer is congruent to precisely one of the integers \n       .\n      This tells us that one way to represent   is\n       .\n\n      Consequently, even though each integer has a congruence class,\n      the set   has only   distinct congruence classes.\n     \n      The set of integers   is more than a set.\n      We can add and multiply integers.\n      That is, there are the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication on the set  ,\n      and we know that   is closed with respect to these two operations.\n     \n      One of the basic problems dealt with in modern algebra is to determine if the arithmetic \n      operations on one set\n       transfer \n      to a related set.\n      In this case, the related set is  .\n      For example, in the integers modulo 5,  ,\n      is it possible to add the congruence classes   and   as follows?\n       .\n     \n      We have used the symbol   to denote addition in\n        so that we do not confuse it with addition in  .\n      This looks simple enough, but there is a problem.\n      The congruence classes   and   are not numbers,\n       they are infinite sets .\n      We have to make sure that we get the same answer no matter what element of   \n      we use and no matter what element of   we use.\n      For example,\n       .\n\n      Do we get the same result if we add   and   in the way we did when \n      we added   and  ?\n      The following computation confirms that we do:\n       .\n     \n      This is one of the ideas that was explored in  Beginning Activity 1 .\n      The main difference is that in this activity,\n      we used the relation of congruence,\n      and here we are using congruence classes.\n      All of the examples in  Beginning Activity 1 \n      should have illustrated the properties of congruence modulo 6 in the following table.\n      The left side shows the properties in terms of the congruence relation and the right side \n      shows the properties

           \n       \n      These are illustrations of general properties that we have already proved in \n       .\n      We repeat the statement of the theorem here because it is so important for

We can actually \n      generalize this property by dealing with remainders when a natural number is divided by 9.\n     \n      Let   and let   denote the sum of the digits of  .\n      For example,

both had the \n      same remainder when divided by 9.\n      The concepts of congruence and congruence classes can help prove that this is always true.\n     \n      We will use the case of   to illustrate the general process.\n      We must use our standard place value system.\n      By this, we mean that we will write   as follows:\n       .\n     \n      The idea is to now use the definition of addition and multiplication in\n        to convert equation (1) to an \n      equation in  .\n      We do this as follows:\n       \n     \n      Since  ,\n        and  ,\n      we can conclude that  ,\n        and  .\n      Hence, we can use these facts and equation   to obtain\n       \n\n      Equation   tells us that 7319 has the same remainder when \n      divided by 9 as the sum of its digits.\n      It is easy to check that the sum of the digits is 20 and hence has a remainder of 2.\n      This means that when 7319 is divided by 9, the remainder is 2.\n     \n      To prove that any natural number has the same remainder when divided by 9 as the sum of its digits,\n      it is helpful to introduce notation for the decimal representation of a natural number.\n      The notation we will use is similar to the notation for the number 7319 \n      in equation  .\n     \n      In general, if  ,\n      and   is the decimal representation of  , then\n       .\n\n      This can also be written using summation notation as follows:\n       .\n     \n      Using congruence classes for congruence modulo 9, we have\n       \n     \n      One last detail is needed.\n      It is given in  .\n      The proof by mathematical induction is  .\n     \n          If   is a nonnegative integer,\n          then  ,\n          and hence for the equivalence relation of congruence modulo 9,  .\n         \n      If we let   denote the sum of the digits of  , then\n       ,\n     \n      Now using equation   and  ,\n      we obtain\n       .\n\n      This completes the proof of

theory in this text in our discussion of \n      proof methods.\n      In particular, we have studied even and odd integers,\n      divisibility of integers, congruence,\n      and the Division Algorithm.\n      See the summary  \n      for a summary of results concerning even and odd integers as well as results \n      concerning properties of divisors.\n      We reviewed some of these properties and the Division Algorithm in the beginning activities.\n     The Greatest Common Divisor \n      One of the most important concepts in elementary number theory is that of the greatest \n      common divisor of two integers.\n      The definition for the greatest common divisor of two integers\n      (not both zero)\n      was given in  Beginning Activity 1 .\n       \n           \n            If   and   and   are not both 0, and if \n             ,\n            then   provided that it satisfies all of the following \n            properties:\n             \n                 \n                    and  .\n                  That is,   is a common divisor of   and  .\n                 \n               \n                 \n                  If   is a natural number such that   and\n                   , then  .\n                  That is, any other common divisor of   and   is less than or \n                  equal to  .\n                 \n               \n           \n         \n           \n            Consequently,\n            a natural number   is not the greatest common divisor of   and \n              provided that it does not satisfy at least one of these properties.\n            That is,   is not equal to   provided that\n             \n                 \n                    does not divide   or   does not divide  ; or\n                 \n               \n                 \n                  There exists a natural number   such that\n                    and   and  .\n                 \n               \n           \n           \n          This means that   is not the greatest common divisor of   and   \n          provided that it is not a common divisor of   and   or that there exists \n          a common divisor of   and   that is greater than  .\n           \n         \n     \n      In the beginning activities,\n      we determined the greatest common divisors for several pairs of integers.\n      The process we used was to list all the divisors of both integers,\n      then list all the common divisors of both integers and, finally,\n      from the list of all common divisors,\n      find the greatest (largest) common divisor.\n      This method works reasonably well for small integers but can get quite cumbersome if the \n      integers are large.\n      Before we develop an efficient method for determining the greatest common divisor of two \n      integers,\n      we need to establish some properties of greatest common divisors.\n     \n      One property was suggested in  Beginning Activity 1 .\n      If we look at the results in   of that beginning activity,\n      we should observe that any common divisor of   and   will divide \n       .\n      In fact, the primary goals of the remainder of this section are\n       \n           \n            To find an efficient method for determining  ,\n            where   and   are integers.\n           \n         \n           \n            To prove that the natural number\n              is the only natural number   that satisfies the \n            following properties:\n             \n                 \n                    divides   and   divides  ; and\n                 \n               \n                 \n                  if   is a natural number such that   and\n                   , then  .\n                 \n               \n           \n         \n     \n      The second goal is only slightly different from the definition of the greatest common divisor.\n      The only difference is in the second condition where\n        is replaced by  .\n     \n      We will first consider the case where   and   are integers with \n        and  .\n      The proof of the result stated in the second goal contains a method\n      (called the Euclidean Algorithm)\n      for determining the greatest common divisor of the two integers   and  .\n      The main idea of the method is to keep replacing the pair of integers\n        with another pair of integers  ,\n      where   and  .\n      This idea was explored in  Beginning Activity 2 .\n       \n      is a conjecture that could have been formulated in  Beginning Activity 2 .\n     \n          Let   and   be integers, not both equal to zero.\n          If   and   are integers such that  ,\n          then  .\n         \n        Let   and   be integers, not both equal to zero.\n        Assume that   and   are integers such that  .\n        For ease of notation, we will let\n         .\n       \n        Now,   divides   and   divides  .\n        Consequently,\n        there exist integers   and   such that   and  .\n        Hence,\n         .\n\n        But this means that   divides  .\n        Since   divides   and   divides  ,\n          is less than or equal to  .\n        Thus,  .\n       \n        Using a similar argument,\n        we see that   divides   and   divides  .\n        Since  ,\n        we can prove that   divides  .\n        Hence,   divides   and   divides  .\n        Thus,   or  .\n        We now have   and  .\n        Hence,   and  . \n       Illustrations of  \n        We completed several examples illustrating  \n        in  Beginning Activity 2 .\n        For another example, let   and  .\n        The greatest common divisor of 56 and 12 is 4.\n       \n              According to the Division Algorithm,\n              what is the remainder   when 56 is divided by 12?\n             \n                The remainder is 8.\n               \n              What is the greatest common divisor of 12 and the remainder  ?\n             \n                 \n               \n              The key to finding the greatest common divisor\n              (in more complicated cases)\n              is to use the Division Algorithm again,\n              this time with 12 and  .\n              We now find integers   such that\n               .\n             \n              What is the greatest common divisor of   and  ?\n             \n                  and  \n               The Euclidean Algorithm Euclidean Algorithm Euclidean Algorithm \n          Let   and   be integers with   and  .\n          Then   is the only natural number   such that\n           \n               \n                  divides   and   divides  , and\n               \n             \n               \n                if   is an integer that divides both   and  ,\n                then   divides  .\n               \n             \n         \n        Let   and   be integers with   and  ,\n        and let  .\n        By the Division Algorithm,\n        there exist integers   and   such that\n         .\n       \n        If  ,\n        then equation   implies that   divides  .\n        Hence,   and this number satisfies \n         Condition \n        and  Condition .\n       \n        If  , then by  ,\n         .\n        We use the Division Algorithm again to obtain integers   and   such that\n         .\n       \n        If  ,\n        then equation   implies that   divides  .\n        This means that  .\n        But we have already seen that  .\n        Hence,  .\n        In addition,\n        if   is an integer that divides both   and  , then,\n        using equation  ,\n        we see that   and,\n        hence   divides  .\n        This shows that   satisfies  Condition \n        and  Condition .\n       \n        If  , then by  ,\n         .\n        But we have already seen that  .\n        Hence,  .\n        We now continue to apply the Division Algorithm to produce a sequence of pairs of integers\n        (all of which have the same greatest common divisor).\n        This is summarized in the following table:\n       Original Pair Equation from Division Algorithm Inequality from Division Algorithm New Pair \n        From the inequalities in the third column of this table,\n        we have a strictly decreasing sequence of nonnegative integers \n         .\n        Consequently,\n        a term in this sequence must eventually be equal to zero.\n        Let   be the smallest natural number such that  .\n        This means that the last two rows in the preceding table will be\n       Original Pair Equation from Division Algorithm Inequality from Division Algorithm New Pair \n        Remember that this table was constructed by repeated use of  \n        and that the greatest common divisor of each pair of integers produced equals \n         .\n        Also, the last row in the table indicates that   divides  .\n        This means that   and hence  .\n       \n        This proves that   satisfies \n         Condition  of this theorem.\n        Now assume that   is an integer such that   divides   and   \n        divides  .\n        We proceed through the table row by row.\n        First, since  ,\n        we see that   must divide  .\n        The second row tells us that  .\n        Since   divides   and   divides  ,\n        we conclude that   divides  .\n        Continuing with each row,\n        we see that   divides each of the remainders  ,\n         ,\n         ,  .\n        This means that   satisfies \n         Condition  of the theorem. \n       \n            Use the Euclidean Algorithm to determine  .\n            Notice that we have deleted the third column (Inequality from Division Algorithm) \n            from the following table.\n            It is not needed in the computations.\n             Original Pair

states that every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime number or a product \n        of prime numbers.\n       prime factorization Greatest Common Divisors and Linear Combinations \n      In  ,\n      we introduced the concept of the greatest common divisor of two integers.\n      We showed how the Euclidean Algorithm can be used to find the greatest common divisor of \n      two integers,\n        and  ,\n      and also showed how to use the results of the Euclidean Algorithm to write the greatest \n      common divisor of   and   as a linear combination of   and  .\n     \n      In this section,\n      we will use these results to help prove the so-called Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic,\n      which states that any natural number greater than 1 that is not prime can be written as \n      product of primes in\n       essentially \n      only one way.\n      This means that given two prime factorizations,\n      the prime factors are exactly the same,\n      and the only difference may be in the order in which the prime factors are written.\n      We start with more results concerning greatest common divisors.\n      We first prove  ,\n      which was part of  \n      in  \n      and  \n      in  .\n     \n         :\n        Let a, b, and t be integers with  .\n        If   divides   and   divides  , then for all integers \n          and  , \n          divides  .\n       \n        Let  ,\n         , and   be integers with  ,\n        and assume that   divides   and   divides  .\n        We will prove that for all integers   and  ,\n          divides  .\n       \n        So let   and let  .\n        Since   divides  ,\n        there exists an integer   such that   and since   divides  ,\n        there exists an integer   such that  .\n        Using substitution and algebra, we then see that\n         \n       \n        Since   is an integer,\n        the last equation proves that   divides   and this proves that for all integers   and  ,\n          divides  . \n       \n     \n      We now let  ,\n      not both 0, and let  .\n       \n      states that   can be written as a linear combination of   and  .\n      Now, since   and  ,\n

 ,\n      we have seen that it is possible to use the Euclidean Algorithm to write their greatest \n      common divisor as a linear combination of   and  .\n      We have also seen that this can sometimes be a tedious,\n      time-consuming process,\n      which is why people have programmed computers to do this.\n      Fortunately, in many proofs of number theory results,\n      we do not actually have to construct this linear combination since simply knowing that it \n      exists can be useful in proving results.\n      This will be illustrated in the proof of  ,\n      which is based on work in  Beginning Activity 1 .\n     \n          Let  ,\n            be nonzero integers and let   be an integer.\n          If   and   are relatively prime and\n           , then  .\n         \n      The explorations in  Beginning Activity 1  were related to this theorem.\n      We will first explore the forward-backward process for the proof.\n      The goal is to prove that  .\n      A standard way to do this is to prove that there exists an integer   such that\n       .\n     \n      Since we are given that  ,\n      there exists an integer   such that\n       .\n     \n      It may seem tempting to divide both sides of equation  \n      by  ,\n      but if we do so,\n      we run into problems with the fact that the integers are not closed under division.\n      Instead, we look at the other part of the hypothesis,\n      which is that   and   are relatively prime.\n      This means that  .\n      How can we use this?\n      This means that   and   have no common factors except for 1.\n      In light of equation  \n      it seems reasonable that any factor of   must also be a factor of  .\n      But how do we formalize this?\n     \n      One conclusion that we can use is that since  ,\n      by  ,\n      there exist integers   and   such that\n       .\n     \n      We may consider solving equation   for   and \n      substituting this into equation  \n      The problem, again,\n      is that in order to solve equation   for  ,\n      we need to divide by  .\n     \n      Before doing anything else,\n      we should look at the goal in equation  \n      We need to introduce   into equation  \n      One way to do this is to multiply both sides of equation   by  .\n      (This keeps us in the system of integers since the integers are closed under multiplication.)\n      This gives\n       \n     \n      Notice that the left side of equation   contains a term,\n       , that contains  .\n      This means that we can use equation   and substitute \n        in equation  .\n      After doing this,\n      we can factor the left side of the equation to prove that  .\n     Completing the Proof of  \n        Write a complete proof of  .\n       \n          Let  ,  , and   be integers.\n          Assume that   and   are relatively prime and  .\n          We will prove that   divides  .\n         \n          Since   divides  ,\n          there exists an integer   such that\n           .\n         \n          In addition,\n          we are assuming that   and   are relatively prime and hence \n           .\n          So by  ,\n          there exist integers   and   such that\n           .\n         \n          We now multiply both sides of equation   by  .\n          This gives\n           \n         \n          We can now use equation 1 to substitute   in \n          equation   and obtain\n           .\n         \n          If we now factor the left side of this last equation,\n          we see that  .\n          Since   is an integer,\n          this proves that   divides  .\n          Hence, we have proven that if   and   are relatively prime and\n           , then  .\n         \n             \n              Let

Before we state the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic,\n      we will discuss some notational conventions that will help us with the proof.\n      We start with an example.\n     \n      We will use

the second part of the theorem by induction on   using the Second \n        Principle of Mathematical Induction.\n        (See  .)\n        For each natural number   with  , let   be\n         \n

2 is a prime number,\n        its only factorization is  .\n        This means that the only equation of the form  ,\n        where   are prime numbers, is the case where   and  .\n        This proves that   is true.\n       \n        For the inductive step, let\n          with  .\n        We will assume that\n          are true.\n        The goal now is to prove that   is true.\n        To prove this,\n        we assume that   has two prime factorizations and then prove that these \n        prime factorizations are the same.\n        So we assume that\n          and that  , where \n

that  ,\n        and hence we may conclude that  .\n        We now use  \n        to conclude that there exists a   with\n          such that  .\n        Since   and   are primes, we conclude that\n         .\n       \n        We have also assumed that   for all   and, hence,\n        we know that  .\n        However, we have also assumed that  .\n        Hence,\n         .\n       \n        We now use this and the fact that   \n        to conclude that\n         .\n       \n        The product in the previous equation is less than  .\n        Hence, we can apply our induction hypothesis to these factorizations and conclude that  ,\n        and for each   from 2 to  ,  .\n       \n        This completes the proof that if   are true,\n        then   is true.\n        Hence, by the Second

Conjectures about Prime Numbers \n         The Number of Prime Numbers \n         \n          Prime numbers have fascinated mathematicians for centuries.\n          For example,\n          we can easily start writing a list of prime numbers in ascending order.\n          Following is a list of the prime numbers less than 100.\n           \n            2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31,

         The question was answered in  Euclid's Elements ,\n          and the result is stated in  .\n          The proof of this theorem is considered to be one of the classical proofs by contradiction.\n         \n         \n              There are infinitely many prime numbers.\n             \n            We will use a proof by contradiction.\n            We assume that there are only finitely many primes, and let\n             \n            be the list of all the primes.\n            Let\n             .\n           \n            Notice that  .\n            So   is either a prime number or,\n            by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic,\n              is a product of prime numbers.\n            In either case,   has a factor that is a prime number.\n            Since we have listed all the prime numbers,\n            this means that there exists a natural number   with\n              such that  .\n            Now, we can rewrite equation   as follows:\n             .\n           \n            We have proved  ,\n            and since   is one of the prime factors of  ,\n            we can also conclude that  .\n            Since   divides both of the terms on the right side of \n            equation  ,\n            we can use this equation to conclude that   divides 1.\n            This is a contradiction since a prime number is greater than 1 and cannot divide 1.\n            Hence, our assumption that there are only finitely many primes is false,\n            and so there must be infinitely many primes. \n           \n       \n         The Distribution of Prime Numbers \n         prime numbers distribution of \n         \n          There are infinitely many primes,\n          but when we write a list of the prime numbers,\n          we

that there exist arbitrarily long sequences of \n          consecutive natural numbers containing no prime numbers.\n          A guided proof of this theorem is included in  .\n           \n

arbitrary integer and   and   are \n                    specific integers.\n                   \n      In the two beginning activities,\n      we were interested only in integer solutions for certain equations.\n      In such instances, we give the equation a special name.\n     Definition Diophantine equation Diophantine equation \n      Diophantine equations are named in honor of the Greek mathematician Diophantus of \n      Alexandria  Diophantus of Alexandria \n      (third century  C.E. ).\n      Very little is known about Diophantus' life except that he probably lived in \n      Alexandria in the early part of the fourth century  C.E.  and was probably the \n      first to use letters for unknown quantities in arithmetic problems.\n      His most famous work,  Arithmetica ,\n      consists of approximately 130 problems and their solutions.\n      Most of these problems involved solutions of equations in various numbers of variables.\n      It is interesting to note that Diophantus did not restrict his solutions to the integers \n      but recognized rational number solutions as well.\n      Today, however,\n      the solutions for a so-called Diophantine equation must be integers.\n     Definition linear Diophantine equation in one variable \n       \n      in  Beginning Activity 1 \n      provides us with results that allow us to determine which linear diophantine equations \n      in one variable have solutions and which ones do not have a solution.\n     \n      A linear Diophantine equation in two variables can be defined in a manner similar to \n      the definition for a linear Diophantine equation in one variable.\n     Definition linear Diophantine equation in two variables \n      The equations that were investigated in  Beginning Activity 2 \n      were linear Diophantine equations in two variables.\n      The problem of determining all the solutions of a linear Diophantine equation has been \n      completely solved.\n      Before stating the general result,\n      we will provide a few more examples.\n     A Linear Diophantine Equation in Two Variables \n          The following example is similar to the examples studied in \n           Beginning Activity 2 .\n         \n          We can use substitution to verify that   and   is a \n          solution of the linear Diophantine equation\n           .\n         \n          The following table shows other solutions of this Diophantine equation.\n         2 5 8 11 3 7 11 15 \n          It would be nice to determine the pattern that these solutions exhibit.\n          If we consider the solution   and   to be the\n           starting point, \n          then we can see that the other solutions are obtained by adding 3 to   and \n          subtracting 4 from   in the previous solution.\n          So we can write these solutions to the equation as\n           ,\n          where   is an integer.\n          We can use substitution and algebra to verify that these expressions for   \n          and   give solutions of this equation as follows:\n           .\n         \n          We should note that we have not yet proved that these solutions are all of the \n          solutions of the Diophantine equation  .\n          This will be done later.\n         \n          If the general form for a linear Diophantine equation is  ,\n          then for this example,   and  .\n          Notice that for this equation,\n          we started with one solution and obtained other solutions by adding   to \n            and subtracting   from   in the previous solution.\n          Also, notice that  .\n         An Example of a Linear Diophantine Equation \n            Verify that the following table shows some solutions of the linear Diophantine \n            equation  .\n\n             2 0 5 8 11 2 4 6 8 \n\n           \n            Follow the pattern in this table to determine formulas for   and   \n            that will generate integer solutions of the equation  .\n            Verify that the formulas actually produce solutions for the equation  .\n           \n                and  ,\n              where   can be any integer.\n              Again, this does not prove that these are the only solutions.\n             Revisiting  Beginning Activity 2 \n        Do the solutions for the linear Diophantine equations in \n         Beginning Activity 2 \n        show the same type of pattern as the solutions for the linear Diophantine equations in \n         \n        and  ?\n        Explain.\n       \n          One of the Diophantine equations in  Beginning Activity 2  \n          was  .\n          We were able to write the solutions of this Diophantine equation in the form\n           ,\n          where   is an integer.\n          Notice that   and   is a solution of this equation.\n          If we consider this equation to be in the form  ,\n          then we see that  ,\n           , and  .\n          Solutions for this equation can be written in the form\n           ,\n          where   is an integer.\n         \n          The other equation was  .\n          So in this case,  ,\n           , and  .\n          Also notice that  .\n          We note that   and   is one solution of this Diophantine \n          equation and solutions can be written in the form\n           ,\n          where   is an integer.\n          Using the values of  ,\n           , and   given above,\n          we see that the solutions can be written in the form\n           ,\n          where   is an integer.\n         \n      The solutions for the linear Diophantine equations in \n       Beginning Activty 2 ,\n       ,\n      and  \n      provide examples for the second part of  .\n     \n          Let  ,  ,\n          and   be integers with   and  , and let\n           .\n           \n               \n                If   does not divide  ,\n                then the linear Diophantine equation   has no solution.\n               \n             \n               \n                If   divides  ,\n                then the linear Diophantine equation\n                  has infinitely many solutions.\n                In addition,\n                if    is a particular solution of this equation,\n                then all the solutions of this equation can be written in the form\n                 ,\n                for some integer   .\n               \n             \n         \n        The proof of   is  .\n        For  , we let  ,\n         ,\n        and   be integers with   and  ,\n        and let  .\n        We also assume that  .\n        Since  ,\n         \n        tells us that   is a linear combination of   and  .\n        So there exist integers   and   such that\n         .\n       \n        Since  ,\n        there exists an integer   such that  .\n        We can now multiply both sides of equation   by   \n        and obtain\n         .\n\n        This means that  ,\n          is a solution of  ,\n        and we have proved that the Diophantine equation\n          has at least one solution.\n       \n        Now let  ,\n          be any particular solution of  ,\n        let  , and let\n         .\n       \n        We now verify that for each  ,\n        the equations in   produce a solution of  .\n         .\n\n        This proves that the Diophantine equation\n          has infinitely many solutions.\n       \n        We now show that every solution of this equation can be written in the form described \n        in equation  .\n        So suppose that   and   are integers such that  .\n        Then\n         ,\n        and this equation can be rewritten in the following form:\n         .\n       \n        Dividing both sides of this equation by  , we obtain\n         .\n       \n        This implies that\n         .\n       \n        However, by   in  ,\n         ,\n        and so by  ,\n        we can conclude that   divides  .\n        This means that there exists an integer   such that  ,\n        and solving for   gives\n         .\n\n        Substituting this value for   in equation   and solving \n        for   yields\n         .\n\n        This proves that every solution of the Diophantine equation\n          can be written in the form prescribed in \n        (2). \n       \n      The proof of the following corollary to  \n      is  .\n     \n          Let  ,  ,\n          and   be integers with   and  .\n          If   and   are relatively prime,\n          then the linear Diophantine equation\n            has infinitely many solutions.\n          In addition, if  ,\n            is a particular solution of this equation,\n          then all the solutions of the equation are given by\n           \n          where  .\n         Linear Diophantine Equations \n            Use the Euclidean Algorithm to verify that  .\n            What conclusion can be made about linear Diophantine equation\n              using  ?\n            If this Diophantine equation has solutions,\n            write formulas that will generate the solutions.\n           \n              Since 21 does not divide 40,\n               \n              tells us that the Diophantine equation   has no solutions.\n              Remember that this means there is no ordered pair of integers\n                such that  .\n              However, if we allow   and   to be real numbers,\n              then there are real number solutions.\n              In fact, we can graph the straight line whose equation is\n                in the Cartesian plane.\n              From the fact that there is no pair of integers\n                such that  ,\n              we can conclude that there is no point on the graph of this line in which both \n              coordinates are integers.\n             \n            Use the Euclidean Algorithm to verify that  .\n            What conclusion can be made about linear Diophantine equation\n              using  ?\n            If this Diophantine equation has solutions,\n            write formulas that will generate the solutions.\n           \n              To write formulas that will generate all the solutions,\n              we first need to find one solution for  .\n              This can sometimes be done by trial and error,\n              but there is a systematic way to find a solution.\n              The first step is to use the Euclidean Algorithm in reverse to write\n                as a linear combination of 144 and 225.\n              See   to review how to do this.\n              The result from using the Euclidean Algorithm in reverse for this situation is\n               .\n              If we multiply both sides of this equation by 3, we obtain\n               .\n              This means that   is a solution of the linear Diophantine equation  .\n              We can now use  \n              to conclude that all solutions of this Diophantine equation can be written in the form\n               ,\n              where  .\n              Simplifying,\n              we see that all solutions can be written in the form\n               ,\n              where  . \n             \n              We can check this general solution as \n              follows:  Let  .\n              Then\n               .\n             Diophantine equation linear in two variables linear Diophantine equations \n          Prove   of  :\n

introduced the concept of equivalent sets.\n      The motivation for this definition was to have a formal method for determining whether or \n      not two sets\n       have the same number of elements. \n      This idea was described in terms of a one-to-one correspondence (a bijection) from one set \n      onto the other set.\n      This idea may seem simple for finite sets, but as we will see,\n      this idea has surprising consequences when we deal with infinite sets.\n      (We will soon provide precise definitions for finite and infinite sets.)\n     equivalent sets Examples of Equivalent Sets \n        We will use the definition of equivalent sets from \n         Beginning Activity 1 \n        in all parts of this progress check.\n        It is no longer sufficient to say that two sets are equivalent by simply saying \n        that the two sets have the same number of elements.\n       \n              Let   and let \n               .\n              Define   by  ,\n              for each   in  .\n              Prove that   is a bijection from the set   to the set \n                and hence,\n               .\n             \n                We first prove that   is an injection.\n                So let   and assume that  .\n                Then   and we can conclude that  .\n                Hence,   is an injection.\n                To prove that   is a surjection, let  .\n                Then   and hence,\n                  and so  .\n                In addition,  .\n                This proves that   is a surjection.\n                Hence, the function   is a bijection,\n                and so,  .\n               \n              Let   be the set of all even integers and let   be the set of all \n              odd integers.\n              Prove that   by proving that  ,\n              where  ,\n              for all  , is a bijection.\n             \n                If   and   are even integers and  ,\n                then   and, hence,  .\n                Therefore,   is an injection.\n                To prove that   is a surjection, let  .\n                This means that   is an odd integer and, hence,\n                  is an even integer.\n                In addition,\n                 .\n                Therefore,   is a surjection and hence,   is a bijection.\n                We conclude that  .\n               \n              Let   be the open interval of real numbers between 0 and 1.\n              Similarly, if   with  ,\n              let   be the open interval of real numbers between 0 and  .\n              Prove that the function   \n              by  ,\n              for all  ,\n              is a bijection and hence  .\n             \n                Let   and assume that  .\n                Then   and, hence,  .\n                Therefore,   is an injection.\n                To prove that   is a surjection,\n                let  .\n                Since  ,\n                we conclude that   and that\n                 .\n                Therefore,   is a surjection and hence   is a bijection.\n                Thus,  .\n               \n      In   of  ,\n      notice that if  ,\n      then   is a proper subset of\n        and  .\n     \n      Also, in   of  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n      we proved that the set   of all odd natural numbers is equivalent to  ,\n      and we know that   is a proper subset of  .\n     \n      These results may seem a bit strange,\n      but they are logical consequences of the definition of equivalent sets.\n      Although we have not defined the terms yet,\n      we will see that one thing that will distinguish an infinite set from a finite set is \n      that an infinite set can be equivalent to one of its proper subsets,\n      whereas a finite set cannot be equivalent to one of its proper subsets.\n     Finite Sets finite set properties of cardinality finite set equivalent sets cardinality equivalent sets Definition finite set properties of infinite set finite set cardinality cardinal number finite set infinite set cardinality  cardinal number  cardinality 0 cardinal number 0 \n      Notice that by this definition,\n      the empty set is a finite set.\n      In addition, for each  ,\n      the identity function on   is a bijection and hence,\n      by definition,\n      the set   is a finite set with cardinality  .\n     \n          Any set equivalent to a finite nonempty set   is a finite set and has the \n          same cardinality as  .\n         \n        Suppose that   is a finite nonempty set,\n          is a set, and  .\n        Since   is a finite set,\n        there exists a   such that  .\n        We also have assumed that   and so by   of \n         \n        (in  Beginning Activity 2 ),\n        we can conclude that  .\n        Since  ,\n        we can use   of  \n        to conclude that  .\n        Thus,   is finite and has the same cardinality as  . \n       \n      It may seem that we have done a lot of work to prove an\n       obvious \n      result in  .\n      The same may be true of the remaining results in this section,\n      which give further results about finite sets.\n      One of the goals is to make sure that the concept of cardinality for a finite set \n      corresponds to our intuitive notion of the number of elements in the set.\n      Another important goal is to lay the groundwork for a more rigorous and mathematical \n      treatment of infinite sets than we have encountered before.\n      Along the way,\n      we will see the mathematical distinction between finite and infinite sets.\n     \n      The following two lemmas will be used to prove the theorem that states that every subset \n      of a finite set is finite.\n     \n          If   is a finite set and  ,\n          then   is a finite set and \n           .\n         \n        Let   be a finite set and assume  ,\n        where   or  .\n        Assume  .\n       \n        If  ,\n        then   and  ,\n        which is equivalent to  .\n        Thus,   is finite with cardinality 1, which equals \n         .\n       \n        If  ,\n        then  ,\n        for some  .\n        This means that  ,\n        and there exists a bijection  .\n        We will now use this bijection to define a function\n          and then prove that the \n        function   is a bijection.\n        We define   as follows: \n        For each  ,\n         \n       \n        To prove that   is an injection,\n        we let   and assume  .\n         \n             \n              If  ,\n              then since   is a bijection,\n               ,\n              and this implies that  .\n             \n           \n             \n              If  , then since  ,\n              we conclude that   and hence  .\n              So  ,\n              and since   and  ,\n              we can conclude that  .\n             \n           \n             \n              The case where   is handled similarly to the previous case.\n             \n           \n       \n        This proves that the function   is an injection.\n        The proof that   is a surjection is  .\n        Since   is a bijection,\n        we conclude that  , and\n         .\n       \n        Since  ,\n        we have proved that  . \n       \n          For each natural number  ,\n          if  ,\n          then   is a finite set and  .\n         \n        We will use a proof using induction on  .\n        For each  , let   be,\n         If  ,\n        then   is finite and  . \n       \n        We first prove that   is true.\n        If  ,\n        then   or  ,\n        both of which are finite and have cardinality less than or equal to the cardinality of \n         .\n        This proves that   is true.\n       \n        For the inductive step, let\n          and assume that   is true.\n        That is, assume that if  ,\n        then   is a finite set and  .\n        We need to prove that   is true.\n       \n        So assume that   is a subset of  .\n        Then   is a subset of  .\n        Since   is true,\n          is a finite set and\n         .\n       \n        There are two cases to consider: Either\n          or  .\n       \n        If  , then  .\n        Hence,   is finite and\n         .\n       \n        If  ,\n        then  .\n        Hence, by  ,\n          is a finite set and\n         .\n       \n        Since  ,\n        we can conclude that  .\n       \n        This means that we have proved the inductive step.\n        Hence, by mathematical induction,\n        for each  ,\n        if  ,\n        then   is finite and  . \n       \n      The preceding two lemmas were proved to aid in the proof of the following theorem.\n     \n          If   is a finite set and   is a subset of  ,\n          then   is a finite set and  .\n         \n        Let   be a finite set and assume that   is a subset of  .\n        If  ,\n        then   is a finite set and  .\n        So we assume that  .\n       \n        Since   is finite,\n        there exists a bijection   for some  .\n        In this case,  .\n        We need to show that   is equivalent to a finite set.\n        To do this, we define   by\n          for each  .\n        Since   is an injection,\n        we conclude that   is an injection.\n        Now let  .\n        Then there exists an   such that  .\n        But by the definition of  ,\n        this means that  ,\n        and hence   is a surjection.\n        This proves that   is a bijection.\n       \n        Hence, we have proved that  .\n        Since   is a subset of  ,\n        we use  \n        to conclude that   is finite and  .\n        In addition, by  ,\n          is a finite set and  .\n        This proves that   is a finite set and \n         . \n       \n       \n      implies that adding one element to a finite set increases its cardinality by 1.\n      It is also true that removing one element from a finite nonempty set reduces the cardinality by 1.\n      The proof of  \n      is  .\n     \n          If   is a finite set and  ,\n          then   is a finite set and \n           .\n         \n      The next corollary will be used in the next section to provide a mathematical \n      distinction between finite and infinite sets.\n     \n          A finite set is not equivalent to any of its proper subsets.\n         \n        Let   be a finite set and assume that   is a proper subset of  .\n        Since   is a proper subset of  ,\n        there exists an element   in  .\n        This means that   is a subset of  .\n        Hence, by  ,\n         .\n       \n        Also, by  \n         .\n       \n        Hence, we may conclude that   and that\n         .\n       \n         \n        implies that  .\n        This proves that a finite set is not equivalent to any of its proper subsets. \n       The Pigeonhole Principle Pigeonhole Principle Pigeonhole Principle \n      In this situation,\n      we can think of the set of pigeons as being equivalent to a set   with cardinality   and the set of pigeonholes as being equivalent to a set   with cardinality  .\n      We can then define a function\n        that maps each pigeon to its pigeonhole.\n      The Pigeonhole Principle states that this function is not an injection.\n      (It is not one-to-one since there are at least two pigeons\n       mapped \n      to the same pigeonhole.)\n     The Pigeonhole Principle \n          Let   and   be finite sets.\n          If  ,\n          then any function   is not an injection.\n         \n        Let   and   be finite sets.\n        We will prove the contrapositive of the theorem, which is,\n        if there exists a function\n          that is an injection,\n        then  .\n       \n        So assume that   is an injection.\n        As in  ,\n        we define a function   by\n          for each  .\n        As we saw in  ,\n        the function   is a bijection.\n        But then   and  .\n        Hence,   and \n         .\n        Hence,  ,\n        and this proves the contrapositive.\n        Hence, if  ,\n        then any function   is not an injection. \n       \n      The Pigeonhole Principle has many applications in the branch of mathematics called\n       combinatorics. \n      Some of these will be explored in the exercises.\n     \n          Prove that the function   in \n            is a surjection.\n         \n          Let   be a subset of some universal set  .\n          Prove that if  ,\n          then  .\n         \n          One way to do this is to prove that the following function is a bijection: \n            by  , for all\n           .\n         \n          Let   be the set of all even natural numbers.\n          Prove that  .\n         \n          One way to prove that   is to find a bijection from   to \n           . One possibility is   by \n            for all  . \n          (We must prove that this is a bijection.)\n         \n          Prove  .\n         \n          If   is a finite set and  ,\n          then   is a finite set and\n           .\n         \n          One approach is to use the fact that  .\n         \n          Notice that  . Use\n            to conclude that   \n          is finite. Then use\n           .\n         \n          Let   and   be sets.\n          Prove that\n         \n          If   is a finite set, then   is a finite set.\n         \n            Since  , if   is finite,\n            then  \n            implies that   is finite.\n           \n          If   is a finite set,\n          then   and   are finite sets.\n         \n            The sets   and   are subsets of  .\n            So if   is finite,\n            then   and   are finite.\n           \n          If   is an infinite set,\n          then   is an infinite set.\n         \n          If   is an infinite set or   is an infinite set,\n          then   is an infinite set.\n         \n          There are over 7 million people living in New York City.\n          It is also known that the maximum number of hairs on a human head is less than 200,000.\n          Use the Pigeonhole Principle to prove that there are at least two people in the city \n          of New York with the same number of hairs on their heads.\n         \n          Prove the following propositions:\n         \n          If  ,  ,  ,\n          and   are sets with\n            and  ,\n          then  .\n         \n            Since   and  , there exist bijections   \n            and  .

be subsets of some of our standard number systems such as \n       ,\n       , and  .\n     Infinite Sets \n      In  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n      we saw how to use  \n      to prove that a set is infinite.\n      This corollary implies that if   is a finite set,\n      then   is not equivalent to any of its proper subsets.\n      By writing the contrapositive of this conditional statement,\n      we can restate   in the following form:\n      Restated \n      If a set   is equivalent to one of its proper subsets,\n      then   is infinite.\n     \n      In  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n      we used   to prove that\n       \n           \n            The set of natural numbers,  , is an infinite set.\n           \n         \n           \n            The open interval   is an infinite set.\n           \n         \n     \n      Although  \n      provides one way to prove that a set is infinite,\n      it is sometimes more convenient to use a proof by contradiction to prove that a set is infinite.\n      The idea is to use results from  \n      about finite sets to help obtain a contradiction.\n      This is illustrated in the next theorem.\n     \n          Let   and   be sets.\n           \n               \n                If   is infinite and  ,\n                then   is infinite.\n               \n             \n               \n                If   is infinite and  ,\n                then   is infinite.\n               \n             \n         \n        We will prove  .\n        The proof of   is\n         .\n       \n        To prove  ,\n        we use a proof by contradiction and assume that   is an infinite set,\n         , and   is not infinite.\n        That is,   is a finite set.\n        Since   and   is finite,\n         \n        on  \n        implies that   is a finite set.\n        This is a contradiction to the assumption that   is infinite.\n        We have therefore proved that if   is infinite and  ,\n        then   is infinite. \n       Examples of Infinite Sets \n            In  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n            we used  \n            to prove that   is an infinite set.\n            Now use this and  \n            to explain why our standard number systems   \n            are infinite sets.\n            Also, explain why the set of all positive rational numbers,\n             ,\n            and the set of all positive real numbers,\n             , are infinite sets.\n           \n              The set of natural numbers   is a subset of  ,\n               ,\n              and  .\n              Since   is an infinite set,\n              we can use   of  \n              to conclude that  ,  ,\n              and   are infinite sets.\n             \n            Let   be the set of all odd natural numbers.\n            In   of  Beginning Activity 1 ,\n            we proved that  .\n            Use  \n            to explain why   is an infinite set.\n           \n              Use   of  .\n             \n

a bijection between the set   and some set that is known to be \n            countably infinite.\n           \n            Let   be the set of all natural numbers that are perfect squares.\n            Define a function\n             \n            that can be used to prove that   and, hence,\n            that  .\n           \n              One function that can be used is   defined by\n                for all  .\n             \n      The fact that the set of integers is a countably infinite set is important enough to be \n      called a theorem.\n      The function we will use to establish that\n        was explored in  Beginning Activity 2 .\n     \n          The set   of integers is countably infinite,\n          and so  .\n         \n        To prove that  ,\n        we will use the following function:\n         , where\n         \n       \n        From our work in  Beginning Activity 2 ,\n        it appears that if   is an even natural number,\n        then  ,\n        and if   is an odd natural number,\n        then  .\n        So it seems reasonable to use cases to prove that   is a surjection and that   is an injection.\n        To prove that   is a surjection,\n        we let  .\n         \n             \n              If  , then  , and\n               .\n             \n           \n             \n              If  ,\n              then   and   is an odd natural number.\n              Hence,\n               .\n             \n           \n       \n        These two cases prove that if  ,\n        then there exists an   such that\n         .\n        Hence,   is a surjection.\n       \n        To prove that   is an injection, we let\n          and assume that  .\n        First note that if one of   and   is odd and the other is even,\n        then one of   and   is positive and the other is less than or \n        equal to 0.\n        So if  ,\n        then both   and   must be even or both   and   must be odd.\n         \n             \n              If both   and   are even,\n              then   and hence that  .\n             \n           \n             \n              If both   and   are odd,\n              then  .\n              From this, we conclude that   =   and hence that  .\n              This proves that if  ,\n              then   and hence that   is an injection.\n             \n           \n       \n        Since   is both a surjection and an injection,\n        we see that   is a bijection and, therefore,\n         .\n        Hence,   is countably infinite and  . \n        \n       \n      The result in   can seem a bit surprising.\n      It exhibits one of the distinctions between finite and infinite sets.\n      If we add elements to a finite set,\n      we will increase its size in the sense that the new set will have a greater cardinality \n      than the old set.\n      However, with infinite sets,\n      we can add elements and the new set may still have the same cardinality as the original set.\n      For example,\n      there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the sets   and  .\n      We say that these sets have the same cardinality.\n     \n      Following is a summary of some of the main examples dealing with the cardinality of sets \n      that we have explored.\n       \n           \n            The sets  ,\n            where  ,\n            are examples of sets that are countable and finite.\n           \n         \n           \n            The sets  ,\n             , the set of all odd natural numbers,\n            and the set of all even natural numbers are examples of sets that are countable \n            and countably infinite.\n           \n         \n           \n            We have not yet proved that any set is uncountable.\n           \n         \n     The Set of Positive Rational Numbers \n      If we expect to find an uncountable set in our usual number systems,\n      the rational numbers might be the place to start looking.\n      One of the main differences between the set of rational numbers and the integers is that \n      given any integer  ,\n      there is a next integer, namely  .\n      This is not true for the set of rational numbers.\n      We know that   is closed under division\n      (by nonzero rational numbers)\n      and we will see that this property implies that given any two rational numbers,\n      we can also find a rational number between them.\n      In fact, between any two rational numbers,\n      we can find infinitely many rational numbers.\n      It is this property that may lead us to believe that there are\n       more \n      rational numbers than there are integers.\n     \n      The basic idea will be to\n       go half way \n      between two rational numbers.\n      For example,\n      if we use   and  ,\n      we can use\n       \n      as a rational number between   and  .\n      We can then repeat this process to find a rational number between\n        and  .\n     \n      So we will now let   and   be any two rational numbers with\n        and let  .\n      We then see that\n       \n     \n      Since  , we see that\n        and so the previous equations show that\n        and  .\n      We can then conclude that  .\n     \n      We can now repeat this process by using\n        and proving that  .\n      In fact, for each natural number, we can define\n       \n      and obtain the result that\n        and this proves \n      that the set\n        is a countably infinite set where \n      each element is a rational number between   and  . (A formal proof can be \n      completed using mathematical induction.) See  .\n     \n      This result is true no matter how close together   and   are.\n      For example,\n      we can now conclude that there are infinitely many rational numbers between 0 and \n       .\n      This might suggest that the set\n        of rational numbers is uncountable.\n      Surprisingly, this is not the case.\n      We start with a proof that the set of positive rational numbers is countable.\n     \n          The set of positive rational numbers is countably infinite.\n         \n        We can write all the positive rational numbers in a two-dimensional array as shown \n        in  .\n       Counting the Positive Rational Numbers \n        The top row in  \n        represents the numerator of the rational number,\n        and the left column represents the denominator.\n        We follow the arrows in  \n        to define  .\n        The idea is to start in the upper left corner of the table and move to successive \n        diagonals as follows:\n         \n             \n              We start with all fractions in which the sum of the numerator and denominator is 2 \n               .\n              So  .\n             \n           \n             \n              We next use those fractions in which the sum of the numerator and denominator is 3.\n              So   and  .\n             \n           \n             \n              We next use those fractions in which the sum of the numerator and denominator is 4.\n              So  ,\n               .\n              We skipped   since  .\n              In this way,\n              we will ensure that the function   is a one-to-one function.\n             \n           \n       \n        We now continue with successive diagonals omitting fractions that are not in lowest terms.\n        This process guarantees that the function   will be an injection and a surjection.\n        Therefore,   and \n         . \n       \n      Note: For another proof of  ,\n      see  .\n     \n      Since   is countable,\n      it seems reasonable to expect that   is countable.\n      We will explore this soon.\n      On the other hand, at this point,\n      it may also seem reasonable to ask,\n       Are there any uncountable sets? \n      The answer to this question is yes,\n      but we will wait until the next section to prove that certain sets are uncountable.\n      We still have a few more issues to deal with concerning countable sets.\n     Countably Infinite Sets \n          If   is a countably infinite set,\n          then   is a countably infinite set.\n         \n        Let   be a countably infinite set.\n        Then there exists a bijection  .\n        Since   is either in   or not in  ,\n        we can consider two cases.\n       \n        If  , then   and\n          is countably infinite.\n       \n        If  ,\n        define   by\n         \n       \n        The proof that the function   is a bijection is  .\n        Since   is a bijection,\n        we have proved that   and hence,\n          is countably infinite. \n       \n          If   is a countably infinite set and   is a finite set,\n          then   is a countably infinite set.\n         \n         .\n       \n       \n      says that if we add a finite number of elements to a countably infinite set,\n      the resulting set is still countably infinite.\n      In other words,\n      the cardinality of the new set is the same as the cardinality of the original set.\n      Finite sets behave very differently in the sense that if we add elements to a finite set,\n      we will change the cardinality.\n      What may even be more surprising is the result in  \n      that states that the union of two countably infinite (disjoint) sets is countably infinite.\n      The proof of this result is similar to the proof that the integers are countably infinite\n      ( ).\n      In fact, if   and  ,\n      then we can use the following diagram to help define a bijection from   to \n       .\n     A Function from   to  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 countably infinite sets union of \n          If   and   are disjoint countably infinite sets,\n          then\n            is a countably infinite set.\n         \n        Let   and   be countably infinite sets and let\n          and   be bijections.\n        Define   by\n         \n       \n        It is left as  \n        to prove that the function   is a bijection.\n       \n      Since we can write the set of rational numbers   as the union of the set of \n      nonnegative rational numbers and the set of negative rational numbers,\n      we can use the results in  ,\n       ,\n      and  \n      to prove the following theorem.\n     \n          The set   of all rational numbers is countably infinite.\n         \n         .\n       \n           countably infinite sets subsets of \n      In  ,\n      we proved that any subset of a finite set is finite\n      ( ).\n      A similar result should be expected for countable sets.\n      We first prove that every subset of   is countable.\n      For an infinite subset   of  ,\n      the idea of the proof is to define a function\n        by removing the elements from   from smallest to the \n      next smallest to the next smallest,\n      and so on.\n      We do this by defining the function   recursively as follows:\n       \n           \n            Let   be the smallest natural number in  .\n           \n         \n           \n            Remove   from   and let   be the smallest natural \n            number in  .\n           \n         \n           \n            Remove   and let   be the smallest natural number in \n             .\n           \n         \n           \n            We continue this process.\n            The formal recursive definition of\n              is included in the proof of \n             .\n           \n         \n     \n          Every subset of the natural numbers is countable.\n         \n        Let   be a subset of  .\n        If   is finite, then   is countable.\n        So we next assume that   is infinite.\n        We will next give a recursive definition of a function\n          and then prove that   is a bijection.\n         \n             \n              Let   be the smallest natural number in  .\n             \n           \n             \n              For each  ,\n              the set   is not empty since   is

Ball: Player 1 Game Board for Dodge Ball: Player 2 \n        Player One has a 6 by 6 array to complete and Player Two has a 1 by 6 row to complete.\n        Each player has six turns as described next.\n         \n             \n              Player One begins by filling in the first horizontal row of his or her table with \n              a sequence of six X's and O's, one in each square in the first row.\n             \n           \n             \n              Then Player Two places either an X or an O in the first box of his or her row.\n              At this point, Player One has completed the first row and Player Two has filled \n              in the first box of his or her row with one letter.\n             \n           \n             \n              The game continues with Player One completing a row with six letters (X's and O's),\n              one in each box of the next row followed by Player Two writing one letter\n              (an X or an O)\n              in the next box of his or her row.\n              The game is completed when Player One has completed all six rows and Player Two \n              has completed all six boxes in his or her row.\n             \n           \n       \n        \n         Winning the Game \n             \n              Player One wins if any horizontal row in the 6 by 6 array is identical to the row \n              that Player Two created.\n              (Player One matches Player Two.)\n             \n           \n             \n              Player Two wins if Player Two's row of six letters is different than each of the \n              six rows produced by Player One.\n              (Player Two\n               dodges \n              Player One.)\n             \n           \n       \n        There is a winning strategy for one of the two players.\n        This means that there is plan by which one of the two players will always win.\n        Which player has a winning strategy?\n        Carefully describe this winning strategy.\n       Applying the Winning Strategy to Lists of Real Numbers \n        Following is a list of real numbers between 0 and 1.\n        Each real number is written as a decimal number.\n         \n       \n        Use a method similar to the winning strategy in the game of Dodge Ball to write a real \n        number\n        (in decimal form)\n        between 0 and 1 that is not in this list of 10 numbers.\n       \n            Do you think your method could be used for any list of 10 real numbers between 0 \n            and 1 if the goal is to write a real number between 0 and 1 that is not in the list?\n           \n            Do you think this method could be extended to a list of 20 different real numbers?\n            To a list of 50 different real numbers?\n           \n            Do you think this method could be extended to a countably infinite list of real numbers?\n           Beginning Activity 2: Functions from a Set to Its Power Set power set power set \n        We are now going to define and explore some functions from a set   to its power \n        set  .\n        This means that the input of the function will be an element of   and the output \n        of the function will be a subset of  .\n       \n            Let  .\n            Define   by\n             \n           \n            Is  ?\n            Is  ?\n            Is  ?\n            Is

 .\n            Define   by\n             .\n           \n            Determine  .\n            Is  ?\n           \n            Determine  .\n            Is  ?\n           \n            Determine  .\n

  such that  ?\n            That is, is  ?\n           \n            Define   by \n             .\n           \n            Determine  ,\n             ,  , and  .\n            In each of these cases, determine if  .\n           \n            Prove that if  ,\n            then  . \n           \n              Prove that if  ,\n              then   and  .\n             \n            Determine  .\n           \n            Notice that  .\n            Does there exist an element   in\n              such that  ?\n            That is, is  ?\n           \n      We have seen examples of sets that are countably infinite,\n      but we have not yet seen an example of an infinite set that is uncountable.\n      We will do so in this section.\n      The first example of an uncountable set will be the open interval of real numbers \n       .\n      The proof that this interval is uncountable uses a method similar to the winning strategy \n      for Player Two in the game of Dodge Ball from  Beginning Activity 1 .\n      Before considering the proof,\n      we need to state an important result about decimal expressions for real numbers.\n     Decimal Expressions for Real Numbers decimal expression for a real number \n      In its decimal form, any real number   in the interval\n        can be written as  ,\n      where each   is an integer with  .\n      For example,\n       .\n     \n      We often abbreviate this as\n        to indicate that the   is repeated.\n      We can also repeat a block of digits.\n      For example,\n        to indicate that the block 230769 repeats.\n      That is,\n       .\n     \n      There is only one situation in which a real number can be represented as a decimal in more \n      than one way.\n      A decimal that ends with an infinite string of 9's is equal to one that ends with an \n      infinite string of 0's.\n      For example,\n        represents the same real number as  .\n      Geometric series can be used to prove that a decimal that ends with an infinite string \n      of 9's is equal to one that ends with an infinite string of 0's, but we will not do so here.\n     Definition decimal expression normalized form normalized form of a decimal expression normalized form \n      One reason the normalized form is important is the following theorem\n      (which will not be proved here).\n     \n          Two decimal numbers in normalized form are equal if and only if they have identical \n          digits in each decimal position.\n         Uncountable Subsets of  \n      In the proof that follows,\n      we will use only the normalized form for the decimal representation of a real number in \n      the interval  .\n     \n          The open interval   is an uncountable set.\n         \n        Since the interval   contains the infinite subset \n         ,\n        we can use  ,\n        to conclude that   is an infinite set.\n        So   is either countably infinite or uncountable.\n        We will prove that   is uncountable by proving that any function from \n          to   is not a surjection,\n        and hence,\n        there is no bijection from   to  .\n       \n        So suppose that   is a function.\n        We will show that   is not a surjection by showing that there exists an element in\n          that cannot be in the range of  .\n        Writing the images of the elements of\n          in normalized form, we can write\n         \n       \n        Notice the use of the double subscripts.\n        The number   is the\n          digit to the right of the decimal point in the normalized decimal \n        representation of  .\n       \n        We will now construct a real number   in\n          and in normalized form that is not in this list.\n       \n        Note: The idea is to start in the upper left corner and move down the diagonal in a \n        manner similar to the winning strategy for Player Two in the game in \n         Beginning Activity 1 .\n        At each step,\n        we choose a digit that is not equal to the diagonal digit.\n       \n        Start with   in  .\n        We want to choose   so that  ,\n         , and  .\n        (To ensure that we end up with a decimal that is in normalized form,\n        we make sure that each digit is not equal to 9.)\n        We then repeat this process with  ,\n         ,  ,\n         , and so on.\n        So we let   be the real number  ,\n        where for each  \n         \n\n        (The choice of 3 and 5 is arbitrary.\n        Other choices of distinct digits will also work.)\n       \n        Now for each  ,\n          since   and   are in normalized form and \n          and   differ in the  {th} decimal place.\n        Therefore,   is not a surjection.\n        This proves that any function from   to\n          is not a surjection and hence,\n        there is no bijection from   to  .\n        Therefore,   is not countably infinite and hence must be an uncountable set.\n         \n       Dodge Ball and Cantor's Diagonal Argument Cantor's diagonal argument Dodge Ball Cantor's diagonal argument \n          Player Two has a winning strategy.\n          On the  th turn,\n          whatever symbol Player One puts in the  th position of the  th row, \n          Player Two must put the other symbol in the  th position of his or her row.\n          This guarantees that the row of symbols produced by Player Two will be different than \n          any of the rows produced by Player One.\n         \n          This is the same idea used in Cantor's Diagonal Argument.\n          Once we have a\n           list \n          of real numbers in normalized form,\n          we create a real number that is not in the list by making sure that its  th \n          decimal place is different than the  th decimal place for the  th number \n          in the list.\n          The one complication is that we must make sure that our new real number does not have \n          a decimal expression that ends in all 9's.\n          This was done by using only 3's and 5's.\n         the cardinal number of the continuum Definition cardinality cardinality cardinality  \n      The proof of  \n      is included in  .\n     \n          Let   and   be real numbers with  .\n          The open interval   is uncountable and has cardinality  .\n         Proof of  \n            In   of  ,\n            we proved that if   and  ,\n            then the open interval   is equivalent to the open interval \n             .\n            Now let   and   be real numbers with  .\n            Find a function\n             \n            that is a bijection and conclude that the open interval\n             .  \n           \n              Find a linear function that passes through the points   and  .\n              Use this to define the function  .\n              Make sure you prove that this function   is a bijection.\n             \n              In order to find a bijection  ,\n              we will use the linear function through the points   and  .\n              The slope is   and the  -intercept is  .\n              So define   by  ,\n              for each  .\n              Now, if   and  , then\n               .\n             \n              This implies that  ,\n              and since  ,\n              we can conclude that  .\n              Therefore,   is an injection.\n             \n              To prove that   is a surjection,\n              we let  .\n              If  , then\n               .\n             \n              This proves that   is a surjection.\n              Hence,   is a bijection and  .\n              Therefore,   is uncountable and has cardinality  .\n             \n            Let   be real numbers with   and  .\n            Prove that the open interaval\n              is equivalent to the open interval  .\n           \n              Now, if   are real numbers with   and  ,\n              then we know that   and  .\n              Since   is an equivalence relation,we can conclude that \n               .\n             \n          The set of real numbers   is uncountable and has cardinality \n           .\n         \n        Let   be \n        defined by  ,\n        for each  .\n        The function   is a bijection and, hence,\n         .\n        So by  ,\n          is uncountable and has cardinality  . \n       Cantor's Theorem Cantor's Theorem Cantor, Georg \n      We have now seen two different infinite cardinal numbers,\n        and  .\n      It can seem surprising that there is more than one infinite cardinal number.\n      A reasonable question at this point is,\n       Are there any other infinite cardinal numbers? \n      The astonishing answer is that there are, and in fact,\n      there are infinitely many different infinite cardinal numbers.\n      The basis for this fact is the following theorem,\n      which states that a set is not equivalent to its power set.\n      The proof is due to Georg Cantor (1845 1918),\n          \n      and the idea for this proof was explored in  Beginning Activity 2 .\n      The basic idea of the proof is to prove that any function from a set   to its \n      power set cannot be a surjection.\n     Cantor's Theorem \n          For every set  ,   and\n            do not have the same cardinality.\n         \n        Let   be a set.\n        If  ,\n        then  ,\n        which has cardinality 1.\n        Therefore,   and\n          do not have the same cardinality.\n       \n        Now suppose that  ,\n        and let  .\n        We will show that   cannot be a surjection,\n        and hence there is no bijection from   to  .\n        This will prove that   is not equivalent to  .\n        Define\n         .\n       \n        Assume that there exists a   in   such that  .\n        Now, either   or  .\n         \n             \n              If  ,\n              then  .\n              By the definition of  ,\n              this means that  .\n              However,   and so we conclude that  .\n              But now we have   and  .\n              This is a contradiction.\n             \n           \n             \n              If  ,\n              then  .\n              By the definition of  ,\n              this means that  .\n              However,   and so we conclude that  .\n              But now we have   and  .\n              This is a contradiction.\n             \n           \n       \n        So in both cases we have arrived at a contradiction.\n        This means that there does not exist a   in   such that  .\n        Therefore, any function from   to\n          is not a surjection and hence not a bijection.\n        Hence,   and   do not have the same cardinality. \n       \n            is an infinite set that is not countably infinite.\n         \n        Since   contains the infinite subset \n         ,\n        we can use  ,\n        to conclude that   is an infinite set.\n        By Cantor's Theorem\n        ( ),\n          and   do not have the same cardinality.\n        Therefore,   is not countable and hence is an \n        uncountable set. \n       Some Final Comments about Uncountable Sets

  "title": "Guidelines for Writing Mathematical Proofs",
  "body": "Guidelines for Writing Mathematical Proofs writing guidelines \n    One of the most important forms of mathematical writing is writing mathematical proofs.\n    The writing of mathematical proofs is an acquired skill and takes a lot of practice.\n    Throughout the textbook,\n    we have introduced various guidelines for writing proofs.\n    These guidelines are in  ,\n     ,\n     ,\n     ,\n     ,\n    and  .\n   \n    Following is a summary of all the writing guidelines introduced in the text.\n    This summary contains some standard conventions that are usually followed when writing a \n    mathematical proof.\n     \n       Know your audience \n         \n          \n          Every writer should have a clear idea of the intended audience for a piece of writing.\n          In that way,\n          the writer can give the right amount of information at the proper level of \n          sophistication to communicate effectively.\n          This is especially true for mathematical writing.\n          For example,\n          if a mathematician is writing a solution to a textbook problem for a solutions manual \n          for instructors,\n          the writing would be brief with many details omitted.\n          However, if the writing was for a students' solution manual,\n          more details would be included.\n         \n       \n         Begin with a carefully worded statement of the theorem or result to be proven \n         \n\n          The statement should be a simple declarative statement of the problem.\n          Do not simply rewrite the problem as stated in the textbook or given on a handout.\n          Problems often begin with phrases such as\n           Show that \n          or\n           Prove that. \n          This should be reworded as a simple declarative statement of the theorem.\n          Then skip a line and write\n           Proof \n          in italics or boldface font\n          (when using a word processor).\n          Begin the proof on the same line.\n          Make sure that all paragraphs can be easily identified.\n          Skipping a line between paragraphs or indenting each paragraph can accomplish this.\n         \n         \n          As an example, an exercise in a text might read,\n           Prove that if   is an odd integer,\n          then   is an odd integer. \n          This could be started as follows:\n           \n            Theorem. If   is an odd integer,\n            then   is an odd integer.\n           \n           \n            Proof: We assume that   is an odd integer  .\n           \n         \n       \n         Begin the proof with a statement of your assumptions \n         \n          Follow the statement of your assumptions with a statement of what you will prove.\n           \n            Proof.\n            We assume that   and   are odd integers and will prove that \n              is an odd integer.\n           \n         \n       \n         Use the pronoun\n           we \n         \n          If a pronoun is used in a proof,\n          the usual convention is to use\n           we \n          instead of\n           I. \n          The idea is to stress that you and the reader are doing the mathematics together.\n          It will help encourage the reader to continue working through the mathematics.\n          Notice that we started the proof of   with\n           We assume that  . \n         \n       \n         Use italics for variables when using a word processor \n         \n\n          When using a word processor to write mathematics,\n          the word processor needs to be capable of producing the appropriate mathematical \n          symbols and equations.\n          The mathematics that is written with a word processor should look like typeset mathematics.\n          This means that variables need to be italicized,\n          boldface is used for vectors,\n          and regular font is used for mathematical terms such as the names of the trigonometric \n          functions and logarithmic functions.\n          For example, we do not write sin x or  .\n          The proper way to typeset this is  .\n         \n       \n         Do not use   for multiplication or ^ for exponents \n         \n   \n          Leave this type of notation for writing computer code.\n          The use of this notation makes it difficult for humans to read.\n          In addition,\n          avoid using   for division when using a complex fraction.\n         \n         \n          For example,\n          it is very difficult to read  ;\n          the fraction\n           \n          is much easier to read.\n         \n       \n         Use complete sentences and proper paragraph structure \n         \n    \n          Good grammar is an important part of any writing.\n          Therefore, conform to the accepted rules of grammar.\n          Pay careful attention to the structure of sentences.\n          Write proofs using  complete sentences \n          but avoid run-on sentences.\n          Also, do not forget punctuation,\n          and always use a spell checker when using a word processor.\n         \n       \n         Keep the reader informed \n         \n\n          Sometimes a theorem is proven by proving the contrapositive or by using a proof \n          by contradiction.\n          If either proof method is used,\n          this should be indicated within the first few lines of the proof.\n          This also applies if the result is going to be proven using mathematical induction.\n          Examples:\n           \n               \n                We will prove this result by proving the contrapositive of the statement.\n               \n             \n               \n                We will prove this statement using a proof by contradiction.\n               \n             \n               \n                We will assume to the contrary that  .\n               \n             \n               \n                We will use mathematical induction to prove this result.\n               \n             \n        \n        In addition,\n        make sure the reader knows the status of every assertion that is made.\n        That is, make sure it is clearly stated whether an assertion is an assumption of the theorem,\n        a previously proven result, a well-known result,\n        or something from the reader's mathematical background.\n         \n       \n         Display important equations and mathematical expressions \n         \n\n          Equations and manipulations are often an integral part of the exposition.\n          Do not write equations, algebraic manipulations,\n          or formulas in one column with reasons given in another column\n          (as is often done in geometry texts).\n          Important equations and manipulations should be displayed.\n          This means that they should be centered with blank lines before and after the \n          equation or manipulations,\n          and if one side of an equation does not change,\n          it should not be repeated.\n          For example,  Using algebra, we obtain\n           .\n          Since     and     are integers,\n          we conclude that  .\n         \n       \n         Equation numbering guidelines \n         \n\n          If it is necessary to refer to an equation later in a proof,\n          that equation should be centered and displayed,\n          and it should be given a number.\n          The number for the equation should be written in parentheses on the same line as the \n          equation at the right-hand margin.\n         \n         \n          Example: Since     is an odd integer,\n          there exists an integer     such that\n           .\n          Later in the proof, there may be a line such as Then,\n          using the result in equation (1), we obtain  .\n          Please note that we should only number those equations we will be referring to later \n          in the proof.\n          Also, note that the word\n           equation \n          is not capitalized when we are referring to an equation by number.\n          Although it may be appropriate to use a capital\n           E, \n          the usual convention in mathematics is not to capitalize.\n         \n       \n         Do not use a mathematical symbol at the beginning of a sentence \n         \n\n          For example, we should not write,\n           Let   be an integer.\n            is an odd integer provided that  . \n          Many people find this hard to read and often have to re-read it to understand it.\n          It would be better to write,\n           An integer   is an odd integer provided that  . \n         \n       \n         Use English and minimize the use of cumbersome notation \n\n         \n   \n          Do not use the special symbols for quantifiers  \n          (for all),\n           \n          (there exists),\n           \n          (such that),\n          or   (therefore) in formal mathematical writing.\n          It is often easier to write, and usually easier to read,\n          if the English words are used instead of the symbols.\n          For example, why make the reader interpret\n           \n          when it is possible to write For each real number  ,\n          there exists a real number   such that  ,\n          or more succinctly\n          (if appropriate)\n          Every real number has an additive inverse.\n         \n       \n       \n         Tell the reader when the proof has been completed \n         \n\n          Perhaps the best way to do this is to say outright that,\n           This completes the proof. \n          Although it may seem repetitive,\n          a good alternative is to finish a proof with a sentence that states precisely what has \n          been proven.\n          In any case, it is usually good practice to use some\n           end of proof symbol \n          such as  .\n         \n       \n         Keep it simple \n         \n          It is often difficult to understand a mathematical argument no matter how well it is written.\n          Do not let your writing help make it more difficult for the reader.\n          Use simple, declarative sentences and short paragraphs,\n          each with a simple point.\n         \n       \n         Write a first draft of your proof and then revise it \n         \n\n          Remember that a proof is written so that readers are able to read and understand \n          the reasoning in the proof.\n          Be clear and concise.\n          Include details but do not ramble.\n          Do not be satisfied with the first draft of a proof.\n          Read it over and refine it.\n          Just like any worthwhile activity,\n          learning to write mathematics well takes practice and hard work.\n          This can be frustrating.\n          Everyone can be sure that there will be some proofs that are difficult to construct,\n          but remember that proofs are a very important part of mathematics.\n          So work hard and have fun.\n         \n       \n   "
