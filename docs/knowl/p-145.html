<p>Suppose that Ed has exactly $52 in his wallet. The following four statements will use the four possible truth combinations for the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If Ed has exactly $52 in his wallet, then he has at least $20 in his wallet. This is a true statement. Notice that both the hypothesis and the conclusion are true.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If Ed has exactly $52 in his wallet, then he has $100 in his wallet. This statement is false. Notice that the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If Ed has $100 in his wallet, then he has at least $50 in his wallet. This statement is true regardless of how much money he has in his wallet. In this case, the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If Ed has $100 in his wallet, then he has at least $80 in his wallet. This statement is true regardless of how much money he has in his wallet. In this case, the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is false.</p></li>
