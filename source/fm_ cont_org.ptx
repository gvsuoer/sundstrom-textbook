  <title>Content and Organization</title>
    <paragraphs>
    <p>
      Mathematical content is needed as a vehicle for learning how to construct and write proofs.
      The mathematical content for this text is drawn primarily from elementary number theory,
      including congruence arithmetic; elementary set theory; functions including injections, surjections,
      and the inverse of a function;
      relations and equivalence relations;
      topics in number theory such as greatest common divisors and prime factorizations;
      and finite and infinite sets.
      This material was chosen because it can be used to illustrate a broad range of proof techniques and it is needed as a prerequisite for many upper-level mathematics courses.
      The chapters in the text can roughly be divided into the following categories:

        Constructing and Writing Proofs:

    <p>
      The first chapter sets the stage for the rest of the book.
      It introduces students to the use of conditional statements in mathematics,
      begins instruction in the process of constructing a direct proof of a conditional statement,
      and introduces many of the writing guidelines that will be used throughout the rest of the book.
      This is not meant to be a thorough introduction to methods of proof.
      Before this is done,
      it is necessary to introduce the students to the parts of logic that are needed to aid in the construction of proofs.
      This is done in <xref ref="C_logic"></xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students need to learn some logic and gain experience in the traditional language and proof methods used in mathematics.
      Since this is a text that deals with constructing and writing mathematical proofs,
      the logic that is presented in <xref ref="C_logic"></xref>
      is intended to aid in the construction of proofs.
      The goals are to provide students with a thorough understanding of conditional statements,
      quantifiers, and logical equivalencies.
      Emphasis is placed on writing correct and useful negations of statements,
      especially those involving quantifiers.
      The logical equivalencies that are presented provide the logical basis for some of the standard proof techniques,
      such as proof by contrapositive,
      proof by contradiction, and proof using cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      The standard methods for mathematical proofs are discussed in detail in <xref ref="C_proofs"></xref>.
      The mathematical content that is introduced to illustrate these proof methods includes some elementary number theory,
      including congruence arithmetic.
      These concepts are used consistently throughout the text as a way to demonstrate ideas in direct proof,
      proof by contrapositive, proof by contradiction,
      proof using cases, and proofs using mathematical induction.
      This gives students a strong introduction to important mathematical ideas while providing the instructor a consistent reference point and an example of how mathematical notation can greatly simplify a concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three sections of <xref ref="C_induction"></xref>
      are devoted to proofs using mathematical induction.
      Again, the emphasis is not only on understanding mathematical induction but also on developing 
      the ability to construct and write proofs that use mathematical induction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last five chapters are considered
      <q>mathematical content</q>
      chapters.
      Concepts of set theory are introduced in <xref ref="C_settheory"></xref>,
      and the methods of proof studied in <xref ref="C_proofs"></xref>
      are used to prove results about sets and operations on sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="C_functions"></xref>
      provides a thorough study of functions.
      Functions are studied before relations in order to begin with the more specific notion with which 
      students have some familiarity and move toward the more general notion of a relation.
      The concept of a function is reviewed but with attention paid to being precise with terminology 
      and is then extended to the general definition of a function.
      Various proof techniques are employed in the study of injections,
      surjections, composition of functions,
      inverses of functions, and functions acting on sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="C_equivrelations"></xref>
      introduces the concepts of relations and equivalence relations.
      <xref ref="S_modulararithmetic"></xref>
      is included to provide a link between the concept of an equivalence relation and the number 
      theory that has been discussed throughout the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="C_numbertheory"></xref>
      continues the study of number theory.
      The highlights include problems dealing with greatest common divisors,
      prime numbers,
      the <term>Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</term>,
      and linear <term>Diophantine</term> equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, <xref ref="C_topicsinsets"></xref>
      deals with further topics in set theory,
      focusing on cardinality, finite sets,
      countable sets, and uncountable sets.

    <title>Designing a Course</title>
    <p>
      Most instructors who use this text will design a course specifically suited to their needs and 
      the needs of their institution.
      However, a standard one-semester course in constructing and writing proofs could cover the first 
      six chapters of the text and at least one of <xref ref="C_equivrelations"></xref>,
      <xref ref="C_numbertheory"></xref>,
      or <xref ref="C_topicsinsets"></xref>.
      Please note that <xref ref="S_recursion"></xref>,
      <xref ref="S_indexfamily"></xref>,
      <xref ref="S_functionsonsets"></xref>,
      <xref ref="S_modulararithmetic"></xref>,
      and <xref ref="S_diophantine"></xref>
      can be considered optional sections.
      These are interesting sections that contain important material,
      but the content of these sections is not essential to study the material in the rest of the book.
