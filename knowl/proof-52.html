<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> be a nonempty set and assume that <span class="process-math">\(\sim\)</span> is an equivalence relation on <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> To prove the first part of the theorem, let <span class="process-math">\(a \in A\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\sim\)</span> is an equivalence relation on <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> it is reflexive on <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(a \sim a\text{,}\)</span> and we can conclude that <span class="process-math">\(a \in [ a ]\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>The second part of this theorem is a biconditional statement. We will prove it by proving two conditional statements. We will first prove that if <span class="process-math">\(a \sim b\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\([ a ] = [ b ]\text{.}\)</span> So let <span class="process-math">\(a, b \in A\)</span> and assume that <span class="process-math">\(a \sim b\text{.}\)</span> We will now prove that the two sets <span class="process-math">\([ a ]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([ b ]\)</span> are equal. We will do this by proving that each is a subset of the other.</p>
<p>First, assume that <span class="process-math">\(x \in [ a ]\text{.}\)</span> Then, by definition, <span class="process-math">\(x \sim a\text{.}\)</span> Since we have assumed that <span class="process-math">\(a \sim b\text{,}\)</span> we can use the transitive property of <span class="process-math">\(\sim\)</span> to conclude that <span class="process-math">\(x \sim b\text{,}\)</span> and this means that <span class="process-math">\(x \in [ b ]\text{.}\)</span> This proves that <span class="process-math">\([ a ] \subseteq [ b ]\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We now assume that <span class="process-math">\(y \in [ b ]\text{.}\)</span> This means that <span class="process-math">\(y \sim b\text{,}\)</span> and hence by the symmetric property, that <span class="process-math">\(b \sim y\text{.}\)</span> Again, we are assuming that <span class="process-math">\(a \sim b\text{.}\)</span> So we have <span class="process-math">\(a \sim b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b \sim y\text{.}\)</span> We use the transitive property to conclude that <span class="process-math">\(a \sim y\)</span> and then, using the symmetric property, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(y \sim a\text{.}\)</span> This proves that <span class="process-math">\(y \in [ a ]\)</span> and, hence, that <span class="process-math">\([ b ] \subseteq [ a ]\text{.}\)</span> This means that we can conclude that if <span class="process-math">\(a \sim b\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\([ a ] = [ b ]\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We must now prove that if <span class="process-math">\([ a ] = [ b ]\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(a \sim b\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(a, b \in A\)</span> and assume that <span class="process-math">\([ a ] = [ b ]\text{.}\)</span> Using the first part of the theorem, we know that <span class="process-math">\(a \in [ a ]\)</span> and since the two sets are equal, this tells us that <span class="process-math">\(a \in [ b ]\text{.}\)</span> Hence by the definition of <span class="process-math">\([ b ]\text{,}\)</span> we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(a \sim b\text{.}\)</span> This completes the proof of the second part of the theorem.</p>
<p>For the third part of the theorem, let <span class="process-math">\(a, b \in A\text{.}\)</span> Since this part of the theorem is a disjunction, we will consider two cases: Either</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
[ a ] \cap [ b ] = \emptyset   \text{ or } [ a ] \cap [ b ] \ne \emptyset\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>In the case where <span class="process-math">\([ a ] \cap [ b ] = \emptyset\text{,}\)</span> the first part of the disjunction is true, and hence there is nothing to prove. So we assume that <span class="process-math">\([ a ] \cap [ b ] \ne \emptyset\)</span> and will show that <span class="process-math">\([ a ] = [ b ]\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\([ a ] \cap [ b ] \ne \emptyset\text{,}\)</span> there is an element <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> such that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x \in [ a ] \cap [ b ]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This means that <span class="process-math">\(x \in [ a ]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x \in [ b ]\text{.}\)</span> Consequently, <span class="process-math">\(x \sim a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x \sim b\text{,}\)</span> and so we can use the second part of the theorem to conclude that <span class="process-math">\([ x ] = [ a ]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([ x ] = [ b ]\text{.}\)</span> Hence, <span class="process-math">\([ a ] = [ b ]\text{,}\)</span> and we have proven that <span class="process-math">\([ a ] = [ b ]\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\([ a ] \cap [ b ] = \emptyset\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_equivclasses.html#proof-52" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
