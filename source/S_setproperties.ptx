        Some of the properties of set operations are closely related to some of the logical operators we studied in <xref ref="S_2logop"></xref>.
        This is due to the fact that set intersection is defined using a conjunction (and),
        and set union is defined using a disjunction
        (or).
        For example,
        if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are subsets of some universal set <m>U</m>,
        then an element <m>x</m> is in
        <m>A \cup B</m> if and only if <m>x \in A</m> or <m>x \in B</m>.

    <title>Algebra of Sets <mdash/> Part 1</title>
    <p>
      This section contains many results concerning the properties of the set operations.
      We have already proved some of the results.
      Others will be proved in this section or in the exercises.
      The primary purpose of this section is to have in one place many of the properties of set operations that we may use in later proofs.
      These results are part of what is known as the
      <em>algebra of sets</em>
          <idx><h>algebra of sets</h></idx>
      or as <em>set theory</em>.

      <p>
        The first part of this theorem was included in <xref ref="exer_intersectandunion"/> from <xref ref="S_provingset"></xref>.
        The second part of the theorem was <xref ref="exer_unionandintersect"/> from <xref ref="S_provingset"></xref>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The next theorem provides many of the properties of set operations dealing with intersection and union.
      Many of these results may be intuitively obvious,
      but to be complete in the development of set theory,
      we should prove all of them.
      We choose to prove only some of them and leave some as exercises.

    <p>
      Before proving some of these properties,
      we note that in <xref ref="S_provingset"></xref>,
      we learned that we can prove that two sets are equal by proving that each one is a subset of the other one.
      However, we also know that if <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> are both subsets of a universal set <m>U</m>, then
      <ul>
        \item <m>S = T</m> if and only if for each <m>x \in U</m>, <m>{x \in S\text{ if and only if } x \in T}</m>.
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can use this to prove that two sets are equal by choosing an element from one set and chasing the element to the other set through a sequence of
      <q>if and only if</q>
      statements.
      We now use this idea to prove one of the commutative laws.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Proof of One of the Commutative Laws in <xref ref="T_algebraofsets"></xref></title>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will prove that <m>A \cap B = B \cap A</m>.
        Let <m>x \in U</m>.
        Then
        <men xml:id="eq_4a">
          x \in A \cap B\text{  if and only if  } x \in A\text{  and  } x \in B
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, we know that if <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are statements,
        then <m>P \wedge Q</m> is logically equivalent to <m>Q \wedge P</m>.
        Consequently, we can conclude that
        <men xml:id="eq_4b">
          x \in A\text{ and } x \in B\text{  if and only if } \;x \in B\text{ and } x \in A
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we know that
        <men xml:id="eq_4c">
          x \in B\text{ and } x \in A\text{  if and only if  } x \in B \cap A
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that we can use <xref ref="eq_4a"/>,
        <xref ref="eq_4b"/>, and <xref ref="eq_4c"/> to conclude that
        <me>
          x \in A \cap B\text{  if and only if  } x \in B \cap A
        </me>,
        and, hence, we have proved that <m>A \cap B = B \cap A</m>.

    <title>Proof of One of the Distributive Laws in <xref ref="T_algebraofsets"></xref></title>
    <p>
      We will now prove the distributive law explored in <xref ref="prog_workingvenn3"></xref>.
      Notice that we will prove two subset relations,
      and that for each subset relation,
      we will begin by choosing an arbitrary element from a set.
      Also notice how nicely a proof dealing with the union of two sets can be broken into cases.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>,
        and <m>C</m> be subsets of some universal set <m>U</m>.
        We will prove that <m>A \cup \left( {B \cap C} \right) = \left( {A \cup B} \right) \cap \left( {A \cup C} \right)</m> by proving that each set is a subset of the other set.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will first prove that <m>A \cup \left( {B \cap C} \right) \subseteq \left( {A \cup B} \right) \cap \left( {A \cup C} \right)</m>.
        We let
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>x \in A \cup \left( {B \cap C} \right)</m>.
        Then <m>x \in A\text{ or } x \in B \cap C</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So in one case, if <m>x \in A</m>,
        then <m>x \in A \cup B</m> and <m>x \in A \cup C</m>.
        This means that <m>x \in \left( {A \cup B} \right) \cap \left( {A \cup C} \right)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if <m>x \in B \cap C</m>,
        then <m>x \in B</m> and <m>x \in C</m>.
        But <m>x \in B</m> implies that <m>x \in A \cup B</m>,
        and <m>x \in C</m> implies that <m>x \in A \cup C</m>.
        Since <m>x</m> is in both sets,
        we conclude that <m>x \in \left( {A \cup B} \right) \cap \left( {A \cup C} \right)</m>.
        So in both cases,
        we see that <m>x \in \left( {A \cup B} \right) \cap \left( {A \cup C} \right)</m>,
        and this proves that <m>A \cup \left( {B \cap C} \right) \subseteq \left( {A \cup B} \right) \cap \left( {A \cup C} \right)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We next prove that <m>\left( {A \cup B} \right) \cap \left( {A \cup C} \right) \subseteq A \cup \left( {B \cap C} \right)</m>.
        So let
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>y \in \left( {A \cup B} \right) \cap \left( {A \cup C} \right)</m>.
        Then, <m>y \in A \cup B\text{ and } y \in A \cup C</m>.
        We must prove that <m>y \in A \cup \left( {B \cap C} \right)</m>.
        We will consider the two cases where <m>y \in A</m> or <m>y \notin A</m>.
        In the case where <m>y \in A</m>,
        we see that <m>y \in A \cup \left( {B \cap C} \right)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we consider the case that <m>y \notin A</m>.
        It has been established that
        <m>y \in A \cup B</m> and <m>y \in A \cup C</m>.
        Since <m>y \notin A</m> and <m>y \in A \cup B</m>,
        <m>y</m> must be an element of <m>B</m>.
        Similarly, since <m>y \notin A</m> and <m>y \in A \cup C</m>,
        <m>y</m> must be an element of <m>C</m>.
        Thus, <m>y \in B \cap C</m> and,
        hence, <m>y \in A \cup \left( {B \cap C} \right)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In both cases,
        we have proved that <m>y \in A \cup \left( {B \cap C} \right)</m>.
        This proves that <m>\left( {A \cup B} \right) \cap \left( {A \cup C} \right) \subseteq A \cup \left( {B \cap C} \right)</m>.
        The two subset relations establish the equality of the two sets.
        Thus, <m>A \cup \left( {B \cap C} \right) = \left( {A \cup B} \right) \cap \left( {A \cup C} \right)</m>.

    <title>Important Properties of Set Complements</title>
    <p>
      The three main set operations are union,
      intersection, and complementation.
      <xref ref="T_algebraofsets">Theorems</xref>
      and <xref ref="T_intersectandunion"></xref>
      deal with properties of unions and intersections.
      The next theorem states some basic properties of complements and the important relations dealing with complements of unions and complements of intersections.
      Two relationships in the next theorem are known as
      <em>De Morgan's Laws</em>
      for sets and are closely related to De Morgan's Laws for statements.

    <proof>
      <p>
        We will only prove one of De Morgan's Laws, namely,
        the one that was explored in Beginning  <xref ref="PA_workingwithvenn2"></xref>.
        The proofs of the other parts are left as exercises.
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be subsets of some universal set <m>U</m>.
        We will prove that <m>\left( {A \cup B} \right)^c  = A^c  \cap B^c</m> by proving that an element is in
        <m>\left( {A \cup B} \right)^c</m> if and only if it is in <m>A^c  \cap B^c</m>.
        So let <m>x</m> be in the universal set <m>U</m>.
        Then
        <men xml:id="eq_4d">
          x \in \left( {A \cup B} \right)^c \text{  if and only if  }  x \notin A \cup B
        </men>,
        and
        <men xml:id="eq_4e">
          x \notin A \cup B\text{  if and only if  } x \notin A\text{  and  } x \notin B
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Combining<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_4d"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_4e"/>, we see that
        <men xml:id="eq_4f">
          x \in \left( {A \cup B} \right)^c \text{  if and only if  } x \notin A\text{  and  } x \notin B
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we know that
        <men xml:id="eq_4g">
          x \notin A \text{  and  }  x \notin B \text{  if and only if  }  x \in A^c \text{  and  }  x \in B^c
        </men>,
        and this is true if and only if <m>x \in A^c  \cap B^c</m>.
        So we can use<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_4f"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_4g"/> to conclude that
        <me>
          x \in \left( {A \cup B} \right)^c \text{  if and only if  } x \in A^c  \cap B^c
        </me>,
        and, hence, that <m>\left( {A \cup B} \right)^c  = A^c  \cap B^c</m>.

      <p>
        It is possible to prove the relationship suggested in <xref ref="A_usingalgebrasets1"/> by proving that each set is a subset of the other set.
        However, the results in <xref ref="T_algebraofsets">Theorems</xref>
        and <xref ref="T_propsofcomplements"></xref>
        can be used to prove other results about set operations.
        When we do this,
        we say that we are using the algebra of sets to prove the result.
        For example,
        we can start by using one of the basic properties in <xref ref="T_propsofcomplements"></xref> to write
        <me>
          \left( {A \cup B} \right) - C = \left( {A \cup B} \right) \cap C^c
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can then use one of the commutative properties to write
        <md>
          <mrow>\left( {A \cup B} \right) - C \amp = \left( {A \cup B} \right) \cap C^c</mrow>

            <p>
              Determine which properties from <xref ref="T_algebraofsets">Theorems</xref>
              and <xref ref="T_propsofcomplements"></xref>
              justify each of the last three steps in the following outline of the proof that <m>\left( {A \cup B} \right) - C = \left( {A - C} \right) \cup \left( {B - C} \right)</m>.
              <md>
                <mrow>\left( {A \cup B} \right) - C \amp = \left( {A \cup B} \right) \cap C^c \amp  \text{ (<xref ref="T_propsofcomplements"></xref>) }</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = C^c  \cap \left( {A \cup B} \right) \amp \text{ (Commutative Property) }</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = \left( C^c \cap A \right) \cup \left( C^c \cap B \right)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = \left( A \cap C^c \right) \cup \left( B \cap C^c \right)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = \left( A - C \right) \cup \left( B - C \right)</mrow>
              </md>
              \note It is sometimes difficult to use the properties in the theorems when the theorems use the same letters to represent the sets as those being used in the current problem.
              For example,
              one of the distributive properties from <xref ref="T_algebraofsets">Theorems</xref>
              can be written as follows:  For all sets <m>X</m>, <m>Y</m>,
              and <m>Z</m> that are subsets of a universal set <m>U</m>,
              <me>

    <title>Proving that Statements Are Equivalent</title>
    <p>
      When we have a list of three statements <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>,
      and <m>R</m> such that each statement in the list is equivalent to the other two statements in the list,
      we say that the three statements are equivalent.
      This means that each of the statements in the list implies each of the other statements in the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of <xref ref="PA_provingequiv"></xref>
      was to provide one way to prove that three
      (or more)
      statements are equivalent.
      The basic idea is to prove a sequence of conditional statements so that there is an unbroken chain of conditional statements from each statement to every other statement.
      This method of proof will be used in <xref ref="T_subsetequivs"></xref>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_subsetequivs">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be subsets of some universal set <m>U</m>.
          The following are equivalent:
          <ol>
            <li xml:id="T_subsetitem1">
              <p>
                <m>A \subseteq B</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li xml:id="T_subsetitem2">
              <p>
                <m>A \cap B^c = \emptyset</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li xml:id="T_subsetitem3">
              <p>
                <m>A^c \cup B = U</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        To prove that these are equivalent conditions,
        we will prove that <xref ref="T_subsetitem1"/> implies <xref ref="T_subsetitem2"/>,
        that <xref ref="T_subsetitem2"/> implies <xref ref="T_subsetitem3"/>,
        and that <xref ref="T_subsetitem3"/> implies <xref ref="T_subsetitem1"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be subsets of some universal set <m>U</m>.
        We have proved that <xref ref="T_subsetitem1"/> implies <xref ref="T_subsetitem2"/> in <xref ref="P_subsetprop"></xref>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove that <xref ref="T_subsetitem2"/> implies <xref ref="T_subsetitem3"/>,
        we will assume that <m>A \cap B^c  = \emptyset</m> and use the fact that <m>\emptyset^c = U</m>.
        We then see that
        <me>
          \left( {A \cap B^c} \right)^c  = \emptyset^c
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, using one of De Morgan's Laws, we obtain
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}A^c \cup \left(B^c \right)^c \amp = U \\ A^c \cup B \amp = U. \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This completes the proof that <xref ref="T_subsetitem2"/> implies <xref ref="T_subsetitem3"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now need to prove that <xref ref="T_subsetitem3"/> implies <xref ref="T_subsetitem1"/>.
        We assume that <m>A^c \cup B = U</m> and will prove that
        <m>A \subseteq B</m> by proving that every element of <m>A</m> must be in <m>B</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So let <m>x \in A</m>.
        Then we know that <m>x \notin A^c</m>.
        However, <m>x \in U</m> and since <m>A^c \cup B = U</m>,
        we can conclude that <m>x \in A^c \cup B</m>.
        Since <m>x \notin A^c</m>, we conclude that <m>x \in B</m>.
        This proves that <m>A \subseteq B</m> and hence that <xref ref="T_subsetitem3"/> implies <xref ref="T_subsetitem1"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we have now proved that <xref ref="T_subsetitem1"/> implies <xref ref="T_subsetitem2"/>,
        that <xref ref="T_subsetitem2"/> implies <xref ref="T_subsetitem3"/>,
        and that <xref ref="T_subsetitem3"/> implies <xref ref="T_subsetitem1"/>,
        we have proved that the three conditions are equivalent.

                    We first write <m>A - \left(B \cup C \right) = A \cap \left(B \cup C \right)^c</m> and then use one of De Morgan's Laws to obtain

                  <p>
                    We now use the fact that <m>A = A \cap A</m> and obtain

                  <p>
                    <m>A - \left(B \cup C \right)= A \cap A \cap B^c \cap C^c = \left(A \cap B^c \right) \cap \left(A \cap C^c \right) = \left(A - B \right) \cap \left(A - C \right)</m>.
