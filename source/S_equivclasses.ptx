      <title>Sets Associated with a Relation</title>
      <p>
        As was indicated in <xref ref="S_equivrelations"></xref>,
        an equivalence relation on a set <m>A</m> is a relation with a certain combination of properties (reflexive,
        symmetric,
        and transitive) that allow us to sort the elements of the set into certain classes.
        This is done by means of certain subsets of <m>A</m> that are associated with the elements of the set <m>A</m>.
        This will be illustrated with the following example.
        Let <m>A = \left\{ {a, b, c, d, e} \right\}</m>,
        and let <m>R</m> be the relation on the set <m>A</m> defined as follows:
        <md>
          <mrow>a \amp \mathrel{R} a  \amp b \amp \mathrel{R} b  \amp c \amp \mathrel{R} c  \amp d \amp \mathrel{R} d   \amp e \amp \mathrel{R} e</mrow>
          <mrow>a \amp \mathrel{R} b  \amp b \amp \mathrel{R} a  \amp b \amp \mathrel{R} e  \amp e \amp \mathrel{R} b</mrow>
          <mrow>a \amp \mathrel{R} e  \amp e \amp \mathrel{R} a  \amp c \amp \mathrel{R} d  \amp d \amp \mathrel{R} c</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        For each <m>y \in A</m>,
        define the subset <m>R[y]</m> of <m>A</m> as follows:
        <me>
          R[y] = \left\{ x \in A \mid x \mathrel{R} y \right\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is, <m>R[y]</m> consists of those elements in <m>A</m> such that <m>x \mathrel{R} y</m>.
        For example, using <m>y = a</m>,
        we see that <m>a \mathrel{R} a</m>, <m>b \mathrel{R} a</m>,
        and <m>e \mathrel{R} a</m>, and so <m>R[a] = \{ a, b, e \}</m>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Determine <m>R[b]</m>, <m>R[c]</m>,
              <m>R[d]</m>, and <m>R[e]</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Draw a directed graph for the relation <m>R</m> and explain why <m>R</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>A</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Which of the sets <m>R[ a ]</m>, <m>R[ b ]</m>,
              <m>R[ c ]</m>, <m>R[ d ]</m>,
              and <m>R[ e ]</m> are equal?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Which of the sets <m>R[ a ]</m>, <m>R[ b ]</m>,
              <m>R[ c ]</m>, <m>R[ d ]</m>,
              and <m>R[ e ]</m> are disjoint?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        As we will see in this section,
        the relationships between these sets are typical for an equivalence relation.
        The following example will show how different this can be for a relation that is not an equivalence relation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>A = \left\{ {a, b, c, d, e} \right\}</m>,
        and let <m>S</m> be the relation on the set <m>A</m> defined as follows:
        <md>
          <mrow>b \amp \mathrel{S} b  \amp c \amp \mathrel{S} c  \amp d \amp \mathrel{S} d   \amp e \amp \mathrel{S} e</mrow>
          <mrow>a \amp \mathrel{S} b  \amp a \amp \mathrel{S} d  \amp b \amp \mathrel{S} c</mrow>
          <mrow>c \amp \mathrel{S} d  \amp d \amp \mathrel{S} c</mrow>
        </md>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Draw a digraph that represents the relation <m>S</m> on <m>A</m>.
              Explain why <m>S</m> is not an equivalence relation on <m>A</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        For each <m>y \in A</m>,
        define the subset <m>S[y]</m> of <m>A</m> as follows:
        <me>
          S[ y ] = \left\{ { {x \in A } \mid x \mathrel{S} y} \right\} = \left\{ { {x \in A } \mid \left( {x, y} \right) \in S} \right\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, using <m>y = b</m>,
        we see that <m>S[b] = \{ a, b \}</m> since
        <m>(a, b) \in S</m> and <m>(b, b) \in S</m>.
        In addition,
        we see that <m>S[a] = \emptyset</m> since there is no <m>x \in A</m> such that <m>(x, a) \in S</m>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Determine <m>S[ c ]</m>, <m>S[ d ]</m>, and <m>S[ e ]</m>.

      <title>Congruence Modulo 3</title>
      <p>
        An important equivalence relation that we have studied is congruence modulo <m>n</m> on the integers.
        We can also define subsets of the integers based on congruence modulo <m>n</m>.
        We will illustrate this with congruence modulo 3.
        For example,
        we can define <m>C[0]</m> to be the set of all integers <m>a</m> that are congruent to 0 modulo 3.
        That is,
        <me>
          C[ 0 ] = \left\{ { {a \in \mathbb{Z} } \mid a \equiv 0 \pmod 3} \right\}\!
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since an integer <m>a</m> is congruent to 0 modulo 3 if and only if 3 divides <m>a</m>,
        we can use the roster method to specify this set as follows:
        <me>
          C[0] = \left\{  \ldots, -9, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, \ldots \right\}
        </me>.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use the roster method to specify each of the following sets:

  <subsection>
    <title>The Definition of an Equivalence Class</title>
    <p>
      We have indicated that an equivalence relation on a set is a relation with a certain combination of properties (reflexive,
      symmetric,
      and transitive) that allow us to sort the elements of the set into certain classes.
      We saw this happen in the beginning  activities.
      We can now illustrate specifically what this means.
      For example,
      in Beginning  <xref ref="PA_congruencemodulo3"></xref>,
      we used the equivalence relation of congruence modulo 3 on
      <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> to construct the following three sets:
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}C[ 0 ] \amp = \left\{ { {a \in \mathbb{Z} } \mid a \equiv 0 \pmod 3} \right\}\!, \\ C[ 1 ] \amp = \left\{ { {a \in \mathbb{Z} } \mid a \equiv 1 \pmod 3} \right\}\!,\text{ and }  \\ C[ 2 ] \amp = \left\{ { {a \in \mathbb{Z} } \mid a \equiv 2 \pmod 3} \right\}\!. \end{aligned}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The main results that we want to use now are <xref ref="T_congtorem">Theorem</xref>
      and <xref ref="C_congtorem">Corollary</xref>
      on <xref ref="T_congtorem">page</xref>.
      This corollary tells us that for any <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
      <m>a</m> is congruent to precisely one of the integers 0, 1, or 2.
      Consequently,
      the integer <m>a</m> must be congruent to 0, 1, or 2, and it cannot be congruent to two of these numbers.
      Thus
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            For each <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
            <m>a \in C[ 0 ]</m>, <m>a \in C[ 1 ]</m>,
            or <m>a \in C[ 2 ]</m>; and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>C[ 0 ] \cap C[ 1 ] = \emptyset</m>,
            <m>C[ 0 ] \cap C[ 2 ] = \emptyset</m> , and <m>C[ 1 ] \cap C[ 2 ] = \emptyset</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that the relation of congruence modulo 3 sorts the integers into three distinct sets,
      or classes,
      and that each pair of these sets have no elements in common.
      So if we use a rectangle to represent <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>,
      we can divide that rectangle into three smaller rectangles,
      corresponding to <m>C[ 0 ]</m>, <m>C[ 1 ]</m>,
      and <m>C[ 2 ]</m>, and we might picture this situation as follows:
    </p>
    <tabular>
      <row>
        <cell>" \use3 \JustCenter <em>The Integers</em> "</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell></cell>
        <cell><m>C[ 0 ]</m> consisting of all integers with a remainder of 0 when divided by 3</cell>
        <cell><m>C[ 1 ]</m> consisting of all integers with a remainder of 1 when divided by 3</cell>
        <cell><m>C[ 2 ]</m> consisting of all integers with a remainder of 2 when divided by 3</cell>
        <cell></cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>
    <p>
      Each integer is in exactly one of the three sets <m>C[ 0 ]</m>,
      <m>C[ 1 ]</m>, or <m>C[ 2 ]</m>,
      and two integers are congruent modulo 3 if and only if they are in the same set.
      We will see that, in a similar manner,
      if <m>n</m> is any natural number,
      then the relation of congruence modulo <m>n</m> can be used to sort the integers into <m>n</m> classes.
      We will also see that in general,
      if we have an equivalence relation <m>R</m> on a set <m>A</m>,
      we can sort the elements of the set <m>A</m> into classes in a similar manner.

        <li>
          <p>
            We use the notation <m>[ a ]</m> when only one equivalence relation is being used.
            If there is more than one equivalence relation,
            then we need to distinguish between the equivalence classes for each relation.
            We often use something like <m>[ a ]_{ \sim}</m>,
            or if <m>R</m> is the name of the relation,
            we can use <m>R[ a ]</m> or <m>[a]_R</m> for the equivalence class of <m>a</m> determined by <m>R</m>.
            In any case,
            always remember that when we are working with any equivalence relation on a set <m>A</m> if <m>a \in A</m>,
            then <em>the equivalence class <m>[ a ]</m> is a subset of <m>A</m>.</em>

            But as we have seen, there are really only three
            <em>distinct</em> equivalence classes.
            Using the notation from the definition, they are:
            <md>
              <mrow>\amp = \left\{ a \in \Z \mid \mod{a}{0}{3} \right\}, \amp  [1] \amp = \left\{ a \in \Z \mid \mod{a}{1}{3} \right\}, \text{ and }</mrow>

      We could have used a similar notation for equivalence classes,

      We have seen that congruence modulo 3 divides the integers into three distinct congruence classes.
      Each congruence class consists of those integers with the same remainder when divided by 3.
      In a similar manner,
      if we use congruence modulo 2, we simply divide the integers into two classes.
      One class will consist of all the integers that have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, and the other class will consist of all the integers that have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.
      That is, congruence modulo 2 simply divides the integers into the even and odd integers.

    <title>Properties of Equivalence Classes</title>
    <p>
      As we have seen,
      in <xref ref="PA_setswithrelation"></xref>,
      the relation <m>R</m> was an equivalence relation.
      For that activity,
      we used <m>R[ y ]</m> to denote the equivalence class of <m>y \in A</m>,
      and we observed that these equivalence classes were either equal or disjoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in <xref ref="PA_setswithrelation"></xref>,
      the relation <m>S</m> was not an equivalence relation,
      and hence we do not use the term
      <q>equivalence class</q>
      for this relation.
      We should note, however,
      that the sets <m>S[ y ]</m> were not equal and were not disjoint.
      This exhibits one of the main distinctions between equivalence relations and relations that are not equivalence relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="T_propsofequivclasses">Theorem</xref>,
      we will prove that if <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation on the set <m>A</m>,
      then we can
      <q>sort</q>
      the elements of <m>A</m> into distinct equivalence classes.
      The properties of equivalence classes that we will prove are as follows:
      <idx><h>equivalence class</h><h>properties of</h></idx>(1) Every element of <m>A</m> is in its own equivalence class; (2) two elements are equivalent if and only if their equivalence classes are equal;
      and (3) two equivalence classes are either identical or they are disjoint.

    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a nonempty set and assume that <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>A</m>.
        To prove the first part of the theorem, let <m>a \in A</m>.
        Since <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>A</m>,
        it is reflexive on <m>A</m>.
        Thus, <m>a \sim a</m>, and we can conclude that <m>a \in [ a ]</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second part of this theorem is a biconditional statement.
        We will prove it by proving two conditional statements.
        We will first prove that if <m>a \sim b</m>,
        then <m>[ a ] = [ b ]</m>.
        So let <m>a, b \in A</m> and assume that <m>a \sim b</m>.
        We will now prove that the two sets <m>[ a ]</m> and <m>[ b ]</m> are equal.
        We will do this by proving that each is a subset of the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, assume that <m>x \in [ a ]</m>.
        Then, by definition, <m>x \sim a</m>.
        Since we have assumed that <m>a \sim b</m>,
        we can use the transitive property of <m>\sim</m> to conclude that <m>x \sim b</m>,
        and this means that <m>x \in [ b ]</m>.
        This proves that <m>[ a ] \subseteq [ b ]</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now assume that <m>y \in [ b ]</m>.
        This means that <m>y \sim b</m>,
        and hence by the symmetric property, that <m>b \sim y</m>.
        Again, we are assuming that <m>a \sim b</m>.
        So we have <m>a \sim b</m> and <m>b \sim y</m>.
        We use the transitive property to conclude that <m>a \sim y</m> and then,
        using the symmetric property,
        we conclude that <m>y \sim a</m>.
        This proves that <m>y \in [ a ]</m> and, hence,
        that <m>[ b ] \subseteq [ a ]</m>.
        This means that we can conclude that if <m>a \sim b</m>,
        then <m>[ a ] = [ b ]</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must now prove that if <m>[ a ] = [ b ]</m>, then <m>a \sim b</m>.
        Let <m>a, b \in A</m> and assume that <m>[ a ] = [ b ]</m>.
        Using the first part of the theorem,
        we know that <m>a \in [ a ]</m> and since the two sets are equal,
        this tells us that <m>a \in [ b ]</m>.
        Hence by the definition of <m>[ b ]</m>,
        we conclude that <m>a \sim b</m>.
        This completes the proof of the second part of the theorem.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the third part of the theorem, let <m>a, b \in A</m>.
        Since this part of the theorem is a disjunction,
        we will consider two cases: Either
        <me>
          [ a ] \cap [ b ] = \emptyset   \text{ or } [ a ] \cap [ b ] \ne \emptyset
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case where <m>[ a ] \cap [ b ] = \emptyset</m>,
        the first part of the disjunction is true,
        and hence there is nothing to prove.
        So we assume that <m>[ a ] \cap [ b ] \ne \emptyset</m> and will show that <m>[ a ] = [ b ]</m>.
        Since <m>[ a ] \cap [ b ] \ne \emptyset</m>,
        there is an element <m>x</m> in <m>A</m> such that
        <me>
          x \in [ a ] \cap [ b ]
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that <m>x \in [ a ]</m> and <m>x \in [ b ]</m>.
        Consequently, <m>x \sim a</m> and <m>x \sim b</m>,
        and so we can use the second part of the theorem to conclude that
        <m>[ x ] = [ a ]</m> and <m>[ x ] = [ b ]</m>.
        Hence, <m>[ a ] = [ b ]</m>,
        and we have proven that <m>[ a ] = [ b ]</m> or <m>[ a ] \cap [ b ] = \emptyset</m>.

      There is a close relation between partitions and equivalence classes since the equivalence classes of an equivalence relation form a partition of the underlying set,
      as will be proven in <xref ref="T_equivclasses-partition">Theorem</xref>.
      The proof of this theorem relies on the results in <xref ref="T_propsofequivclasses">Theorem</xref>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_equivclasses-partition">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\sim</m> be an equivalence relation on the nonempty set <m>A</m>.
          Then the collection <m>\mathcal{C}</m> of all equivalence classes determined by <m>\sim</m> is a partition of the set <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>\sim</m> be an equivalence relation on the nonempty set <m>A</m>,
        and let <m>\mathcal{C}</m> be the collection of all equivalence classes determined by <m>\sim</m>.
        That is,
        <me>
          \mathcal{C} = \left\{ { {[ a ]} \mid a \in A} \right\}\!
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use <xref ref="T_propsofequivclasses">Theorem</xref>
        to prove that <m>\mathcal{C}</m> is a partition of <m>A</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Part<nbsp/><xref ref="T_propsofequivclasses1"/> of <xref ref="T_propsofequivclasses">Theorem</xref>
        states that for each <m>a \in A</m>, <m>a \in [ a ]</m>.
        In terms of the equivalence classes,
        this means that each equivalence class is nonempty since each element of <m>A</m> is in its own equivalence class.
        Consequently, <m>\mathcal{C}</m>,
        the collection of all equivalence classes determined by <m>\sim</m>,
        satisfies the first two conditions of the definition of a partition.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must now show that the collection
        <m>\mathcal{C}</m> of all equivalence classes determined by <m>\sim</m> satisfies the third condition for being a partition.
        That is, we need to show that any two equivalence classes are either equal or are disjoint.
        However, this is exactly the result in Part<nbsp/><xref ref="T_propsofequivclasses3"/> of <xref ref="T_propsofequivclasses">Theorem</xref>.
      </p>

        Hence, we have proven that the collection
        <m>\mathcal{C}</m> of all equivalence classes determined by <m>\sim</m> is a partition of the set <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      \note <xref ref="T_equivclasses-partition">Theorem</xref>
      has shown us that if <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation on a nonempty set <m>A</m>,
      then the collection of the equivalence classes determined by <m>\sim</m> form a partition of the set <m>A</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process can be reversed.
      This means that given a partition
      <m>\mathcal{C}</m> of a nonempty set <m>A</m>,
      we can define an equivalence relation on <m>A</m> whose equivalence classes are precisely the subsets of <m>A</m> that form the partition.
      This will be explored in Exercise<nbsp/><xref ref="exer_partition-equivrelation"/>.

                Define a relation <m>\approx</m> on
                <m>\mathcal{M}_{n, n}( \R )</m> as follows: For all <m>A, B \in \mathcal{M}_{n, n}( \R )</m>,
                <m>A \approx B</m> if and only if <m>\text{ det } (A) \sim \text{ det } (B)</m>.
                Is <m>\approx</m> an equivalence relation on <m>\mathcal{M}_{n, n}( \R )</m>?
                Justify your conclusion.
