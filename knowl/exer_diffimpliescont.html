<div class="introduction">
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> be a real number and let <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> be a real-valued function defined on an interval containing <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{.}\)</span> Consider the following conditional statement: <blockquote class="blockquote">If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> Which of the following statements have the same meaning as this conditional statement and which ones are negations of this conditional statement?</p>
<p>Note: This is not asking which statements are true and which are false. It is asking which statements are logically equivalent to the given statement. It might be helpful to let <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> represent the hypothesis of the given statement, <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> represent the conclusion, and then determine a symbolic representation for each statement. Instead of using truth tables, try to use already established logical equivalencies to justify your conclusions.</p>
