<p>When using a counterexample to prove a statement is false, we do not use the term “proof” since we reserve a proof for proving a proposition is true. We could summarize our work as follows: <article class="assemblage assemblage-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Conjecture.</span></h4>
<p>For each integer <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> if 5 divides <span class="process-math">\(\left(n^2 - 1 \right)\text{,}\)</span> then 5 divides <span class="process-math">\(\left( n - 1 \right)\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>The integer <span class="process-math">\(n = 4\)</span> is a counterexample that proves this conjecture is false. Notice that when <span class="process-math">\(n = 4\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(n^2 - 1 = 15\)</span> and 5 divides 15. Hence, the hypothesis of the conjecture is true in this case. In addition, <span class="process-math">\(n - 1 = 3\)</span> and 5 does not divide 3 and so the conclusion of the conjecture is false in this case. Since this is an example where the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false, the conjecture is false.</p></article> As a general rule of thumb, anytime we are trying to decide if a proposition is true or false, it is a good idea to try some examples first. The examples that are chosen should be ones in which the hypothesis of the proposition is true. If one of these examples makes the conclusion false, then we have found a counterexample and we know the proposition is false. If all of the examples produce a true conclusion, then we have evidence that the proposition is true and can try to write a proof.</p>
