<section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Emphasis on Active Learning.</span></h5>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">One of the underlying premises of this text is that the best way to learn and understand mathematics is to be actively involved in the learning process. However, it is unlikely that students will learn all the mathematics in a given course on their own. Students actively involved in learning mathematics need appropriate materials that will provide guidance and support in their learning of mathematics. There are several ways this text promotes active learning.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">With the exception of <a href="S_reviewproofs.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.6: Review of Proof Methods">Section 3.6</a>, each section has exactly two beginning activities. These activities should be completed by the students prior to the classroom discussion of the section. The purpose of the beginning activities is to prepare students to participate in the classroom discussion of the section. Some of these activities will review prior mathematical work that is necessary for the new section. This prior work may contain material from previous mathematical courses or it may contain  material covered earlier in this text. Other beginning activities will introduce new concepts and definitions that will be used when that section is discussed in class.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Several Progress Checks are included in each section. These are either short exercises or short activities designed to help the students determine if they are understanding the material as it is presented. Some progress checks are also intended to prepare the student for the next topic in the section. Answers to the Progress Checks are provided in <a href="prog-answers.html" class="internal" title="Appendix B: Answers for the Progress Checks">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Explorations and activities are included at the end of the exercises of each section. These activities can be done individually or in a collaborative learning setting, where students work in groups to brainstorm, make conjectures, test each other's ideas, reach consensus, and, it is hoped, develop sound mathematical arguments to support their work. These activities can also be assigned as homework in addition to the other exercises at the end of each section.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="fm-imp-features.html#paragraphs-3">in-context</a></span>
