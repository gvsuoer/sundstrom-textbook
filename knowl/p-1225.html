<p>We now have to prove that a certain integer <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> exists, so we ask the question, “How do we prove that this integer exists?” When we are at such a stage in the backward process of a proof, we usually turn to what is known in order to prove that the object exists or to find or construct the object we are trying to prove exists. We often say that we try to “construct” the object or at least prove it exists from the known information. So at this point, we go to the forward part of the proof to try to prove that there exists an integer <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(c = a \cdot q\text{.}\)</span></p>
