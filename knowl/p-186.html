<p> The primary number system used in algebra and calculus is the <dfn class="terminology">real number system</dfn>. We usually use the symbol <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> to stand for the set of all real numbers. The real numbers consist of the rational numbers and the irrational numbers. The <dfn class="terminology">rational numbers</dfn> are those real numbers that can be written as a quotient of two integers (with a nonzero denominator), and the <dfn class="terminology">irrational numbers</dfn> are those real numbers that cannot be written as a quotient of two integers. That is, a rational number can be written in the form of a fraction, and an irrational number cannot be written in the form of a fraction. Some common irrational numbers are <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\pi\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> We usually use the symbol <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> to represent the set of all rational numbers. (The letter <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> is used because rational numbers are quotients of integers.) There is no standard symbol for the set of all irrational numbers.</p>
