<dt>Proposition</dt>
<dd><p>All dogs are the same breed.</p></dd>
<dt>Proof</dt>
<dd>
<p>We will prove this proposition using mathematical induction. For each natural number <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> we let <span class="process-math">\(P( n )\)</span> be</p>
<p>Any set of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> dogs consists entirely of dogs of the same breed.</p>
<p>We will prove that for each natural number <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P( n )\)</span> is true, which will prove that all dogs are the same breed. A set with only one dog consists entirely of dogs of the same breed and, hence, <span class="process-math">\(P( 1 )\)</span> is true.</p>
<p>So we let <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> be a natural number and assume that <span class="process-math">\(P( k )\)</span> is true, that is, that every set of <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> dogs consists of dogs of the same breed. Now consider a set <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(k + 1\)</span> dogs, where</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
D = \left\{ d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k, d_{k+1} \right\}\!\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>If we remove the dog <span class="process-math">\(d_1\)</span> from the set <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> we then have a set <span class="process-math">\(D_1\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> dogs, and using the assumption that <span class="process-math">\(P( k )\)</span> is true, these dogs must all be of the same breed. Similarly, if we remove <span class="process-math">\(d_{k+1}\)</span> from the set <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> we again have a set <span class="process-math">\(D_2\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> dogs, and these dogs must all be of the same breed. Since <span class="process-math">\(D = D_1 \cup D_2\text{,}\)</span> we have proved that all of the dogs in <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> must be of the same breed.</p>
<p>This proves that if <span class="process-math">\(P( k )\)</span> is true, then <span class="process-math">\(P( k + 1 )\)</span> is true and, hence, by mathematical induction, we have proved that for each natural number <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> any set of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> dogs consists entirely of dogs of the same breed.</p>
