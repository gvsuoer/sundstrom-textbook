<p>In <a href="S_introfunctions.html" class="internal" title="Section 6.1: Introduction to Functions">SectionÂ 6.1</a>, we have seen many examples of functions. We have also seen various ways to represent functions and to convey information about them. For example, we have seen that the rule for determining outputs of a function can be given by a formula, a graph, or a table of values. We have also seen that sometimes it is more convenient to give a verbal description of the rule for a function. In cases where the domain and codomain are small, finite sets, we used an arrow diagram to convey information about how inputs and outputs are associated without explicitly stating a rule. In this section, we will study some types of functions, some of which we may not have encountered in previous mathematics courses.</p>
