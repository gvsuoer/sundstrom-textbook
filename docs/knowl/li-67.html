</h4>
<p>This should be a simple declarative statement of the theorem or result. Do not simply rewrite the problem as stated in the textbook or given on a handout. Problems often begin with phrases such as “Show that” or “Prove that.” This should be reworded as a simple declarative statement of the theorem. Then skip a line and write “Proof” in italics or boldface font (when using a word processor). Begin the proof on the same line. Make sure that all paragraphs can be easily identified. Skipping a line between paragraphs or indenting each paragraph can accomplish this.</p>
<p>As an example, an exercise in a text might read, “Prove that if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an odd integer, then <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> is an odd integer.” This could be started as follows: <blockquote class="blockquote">
<em class="emphasis">Theorem.</em> If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an odd integer, then <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> is an odd integer.</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">
<em class="emphasis">Proof</em>: We assume that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an odd integer <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\)</span>
