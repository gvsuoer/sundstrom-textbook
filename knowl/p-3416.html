<p>In elementary mathematics, the notion of an ordered pair introduced at the beginning of this section will suffice. However, if we are interested in a formal development of the Cartesian product of two sets, we need a more precise definition of ordered pair. Following is one way to do this in terms of sets. This definition is credited to Kazimierz Kuratowski (1896 â€” 1980). Kuratowski was a famous Polish mathematician whose main work was in the areas of topology and set theory. He was appointed the Director of the Polish Academy of Sciences and served in that position for 19 years. Let  <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>  be an element of the set  <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> and let  <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>  be an element of the set  <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> The <dfn class="terminology">ordered pair</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(\left( {x,y} \right)\)</span> is defined to be the set <span class="process-math">\(\left\{ {\left\{ x \right\},\left\{ {x,y} \right\}} \right\}\text{.}\)</span> That is,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\left( {x,y} \right) = \left\{ {\left\{ x \right\},\left\{ {x,y} \right\}} \right\}\!\text{.}
\end{equation*}
