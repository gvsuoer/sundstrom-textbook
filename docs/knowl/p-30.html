<p>So the know-show tables are not to be considered an absolute necessity in using the text. However, they are useful for students beginning to learn how to construct and write proofs. They provide a convenient way for students to organize their work. More importantly, they introduce students to a way of thinking about a problem. Instead of immediately trying to write a complete proof, the know-show table forces students to stop, think, and ask questions such as <blockquote class="blockquote">Just exactly what is it that I am trying to prove?</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">How can I prove this?</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">What methods do I have that may allow me to prove this?</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">What are the assumptions?</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">How can I use these assumptions to prove the result?</blockquote> Being able to ask these questions is a big step in constructing a proof. The next task is to answer the questions and to use those answers to construct a proof.</p>
