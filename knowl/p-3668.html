<p>Besides the domain and codomain, there is another important set associated with a function. The need for this was illustrated in the example of the function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/functionterms.html" title="Paragraphs: Some Function Terminology with an Example">Some Function Terminology with an Example</a>. For this function, it was noticed that there are elements in the codomain that have no preimage or, equivalently, there are elements in the codomain that are not the image of any element in the domain. The set we are talking about is the subset of the codomain consisting of all images of the elements of the domain of the function, and it is called the range of the function.</p>
