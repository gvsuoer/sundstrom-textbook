<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> be a finite set and assume that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a subset of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(A = \emptyset\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a finite set and <span class="process-math">\(\text{ card} ( A ) \leq \text{ card} ( S )\text{.}\)</span> So we assume that <span class="process-math">\(A \ne \emptyset\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is finite, there exists a bijection <span class="process-math">\(f\x S \to \mathbb{N}_k\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(k \in \mathbb{N}\text{.}\)</span> In this case, <span class="process-math">\(\text{ card} ( S ) = k\text{.}\)</span> We need to show that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is equivalent to a finite set. To do this, we define <span class="process-math">\(g\x A \to f ( A )\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(g ( x ) = f ( x )\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(x \in A\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is an injection, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is an injection. Now let <span class="process-math">\(y \in f ( A )\text{.}\)</span> Then there exists an <span class="process-math">\(a \in A\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f ( a ) = y\text{.}\)</span> But by the definition of <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> this means that <span class="process-math">\(g ( a ) = y\text{,}\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is a surjection. This proves that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is a bijection.</p>
<p>Hence, we have proved that <span class="process-math">\(A \approx f ( A )\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(f ( A )\)</span> is a subset of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{N}_k\text{,}\)</span> we use <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/L_subsetsofNk.html" title="Lemma 9.5">Lemma 9.5</a> to conclude that <span class="process-math">\(f ( A )\)</span> is finite and <span class="process-math">\(\text{ card} ( f ( A ) ) \leq k\text{.}\)</span> In addition, by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_equivfinitesets.html" title="Theorem 9.3">Theorem 9.3</a>, <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a finite set and <span class="process-math">\(\text{ card} ( A ) = \text{ card} ( f ( A ) )\text{.}\)</span> This proves that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a finite set and <span class="process-math">\(\text{ card} ( A ) \leq \text{ card} ( S )\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_finitesets.html#proof-64" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
