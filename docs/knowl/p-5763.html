<p>If we expect to find an uncountable set in our usual number systems, the rational numbers might be the place to start looking. One of the main differences between the set of rational numbers and the integers is that given any integer \(m\text{,}\) there is a next integer, namely \(m + 1\text{.}\) This is not true for the set of rational numbers. We know that \(\Q\) is closed under division (by nonzero rational numbers) and we will see that this property implies that given any two rational numbers, we can also find a rational number between them. In fact, between any two rational numbers, we can find infinitely many rational numbers. It is this property that may lead us to believe that there are “more” rational numbers than there are integers.</p>
