<p>Much of our work in mathematics deals with statements. In mathematics, a <dfn class="terminology">statement</dfn> is a declarative sentence that must have a definite truth value, either true or false but not both. A statement is sometimes called a <dfn class="terminology">proposition</dfn>.  The key is that there must be no ambiguity. To be a statement, a sentence must be true or false, and it cannot be both. So a sentence such as “The sky is beautiful” is not a statement since whether the sentence is true or not is a matter of opinion. A question such as “Is it raining?” is not a statement because it is a question and is not declaring or asserting that something is true.</p>
