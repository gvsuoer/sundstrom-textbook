<p>Diophantine equations are named in honor of the Greek mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria  (third century <abbr class="abbreviation">C.E.</abbr>). Very little is known about Diophantus' life except that he probably lived in Alexandria in the early part of the fourth century <abbr class="abbreviation">C.E.</abbr> and was probably the first to use letters for unknown quantities in arithmetic problems. His most famous work, <span class="booktitle">Arithmetica</span>, consists of approximately 130 problems and their solutions. Most of these problems involved solutions of equations in various numbers of variables. It is interesting to note that Diophantus did not restrict his solutions to the integers but recognized rational number solutions as well. Today, however, the solutions for a so-called Diophantine equation must be integers.</p>
