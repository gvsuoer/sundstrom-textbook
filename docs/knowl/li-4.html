<p>With the exception of <code xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "S_reviewproofs" missing or not unique]</code>, each section has exactly two beginning activities. Some of these activities will review prior mathematical work that is necessary for the new section. This prior work may contain material from previous mathematical courses or it may contain material covered earlier in this text. Other beginning activities will introduce new concepts and definitions that will be used when that section is discussed in class. It is very important that you work on these beginning activities before starting the rest of the section. Please note that answers to these beginning activities are not included in the text. This book is designed to be used for a course and it is left up to the discretion of each individual instructor as to how to distribute the answers to the beginning activities.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="fm-student-note.html#li-4">in-context</a></span>
