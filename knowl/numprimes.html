</h4>
<p>Prime numbers have fascinated mathematicians for centuries. For example, we can easily start writing a list of prime numbers in ascending order. Following is a list of the prime numbers less than 100. <blockquote class="blockquote">2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97</blockquote></p>
<p>This list contains the first 25 prime numbers. Does this list ever stop? The question was answered in <span class="booktitle">Euclid's Elements</span>, and the result is stated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_infiniteprimes.html" title="Theorem 8.18">TheoremÂ 8.18</a>. The proof of this theorem is considered to be one of the classical proofs by contradiction.</p>

<p>We will use a proof by contradiction. We assume that there are only finitely many primes, and let</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
p_1 , p_2 ,  \ldots , p_m
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">be the list of all the primes. Let</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation}
M = p_1 p_2  \cdots p_m  + 1\text{.}\tag{76}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p>Notice that <span class="process-math">\(M \ne 1\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is either a prime number or, by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is a product of prime numbers. In either case, <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> has a factor that is a prime number. Since we have listed all the prime numbers, this means that there exists a natural number <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(1 \leq j \leq m\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(p_j \mid  M\text{.}\)</span> Now, we can rewrite equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_infiniteprimes1.html" title="Equation 76">(76)</a> as follows:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/T_infiniteprimes1.html">
\begin{equation}
1 = M - p_1 p_2  \cdots p_m\text{.}\tag{77}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p>We have proved <span class="process-math">\(p_j \mid M\text{,}\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(p_j\)</span> is one of the prime factors of <span class="process-math">\(p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m\text{,}\)</span> we can also conclude that <span class="process-math">\(p_j \mid \left( {p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m } \right)\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(p_j\)</span> divides both of the terms on the right side of equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_infiniteprimes2.html" title="Equation 77">(77)</a>, we can use this equation to conclude that <span class="process-math">\(p_j\)</span> divides 1. This is a contradiction since a prime number is greater than 1 and cannot divide 1. Hence, our assumption that there are only finitely many primes is false, and so there must be infinitely many primes.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_primefactorizations.html#numprimes" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
