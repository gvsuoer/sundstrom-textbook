<p>Technical Note: The three properties we proved in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_equivsets.html" title="Theorem 9.1">TheoremÂ 9.1</a> in <a href="S_finitesets.html#PA_equivsets2" class="internal" title="Beginning Activity: Beginning Activity 2: Equivalent Sets, Part 2">Beginning Activity 2</a> are very similar to the concepts of reflexive, symmetric, and transitive relations. However, we do not consider equivalence of sets to be an equivalence relation on a set <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> since an equivalence relation requires an underlying (universal) set <span class="process-math">\(U\text{.}\)</span> In this case, our elements would be the sets <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> and these would then have to be subsets of some universal set <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> (elements of the power set of <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span>). For equivalence of sets, we are not requiring that the sets <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> be subsets of the same universal set. So we do not use the term relation in regards to the equivalence of sets. However, if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are sets and <span class="process-math">\(A \approx B\text{,}\)</span> then we often say that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are <dfn class="terminology">equivalent sets</dfn>.</p>
