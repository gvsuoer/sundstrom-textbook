    <title>Greatest Common Divisors and Linear Combinations</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="S_gcd"></xref>,
      we introduced the concept of the greatest common divisor of two integers.
      We showed how the Euclidean Algorithm can be used to find the greatest common divisor of 
      two integers,
      <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
      and also showed how to use the results of the Euclidean Algorithm to write the greatest 
      common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> as a linear combination of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we will use these results to help prove the so-called Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic,
      which states that any natural number greater than 1 that is not prime can be written as 
      product of primes in
      <q>essentially</q>
      only one way.
      This means that given two prime factorizations,
      the prime factors are exactly the same,
      and the only difference may be in the order in which the prime factors are written.
      We start with more results concerning greatest common divisors.
      We first prove <xref ref="P_divlinearcomb"></xref>,
      which was part of <xref ref="exer52-choose"/>
      in <xref ref="S_provingset"></xref>
      and <xref ref="exer81_lincomb"/>
      in <xref ref="S_gcd"></xref>.
    </p>
      <p>
        <xref ref="P_divlinearcomb"/>:
        Let a, b, and t be integers with <m>t \ne 0</m>.
        If <m>t</m> divides <m>a</m> and <m>t</m> divides <m>b</m>, then for all integers 
        <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, 
        <m>t</m> divides <m>\left( ax + by \right)</m>.
      <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>a</m>,
        <m>b</m>, and <m>t</m> be integers with <m>t \ne 0</m>,
        and assume that <m>t</m> divides <m>a</m> and <m>t</m> divides <m>b</m>.
        We will prove that for all integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
        <m>t</m> divides <m>(ax + by)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So let <m>x \in \mathbb{Z}</m> and let <m>y \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
        Since <m>t</m> divides <m>a</m>,
        there exists an integer <m>m</m> such that <m>a = mt</m> and since <m>t</m> divides <m>b</m>,
        there exists an integer <m>n</m> such that <m>b = nt</m>.
        Using substitution and algebra, we then see that
        <md>
          <mrow>ax + by \amp = (mt)x + (nt)y</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = t(mx + ny)</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>(mx + ny)</m> is an integer,
        the last equation proves that <m>t</m> divides <m>ax + by</m> and this proves that for all integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
        <m>t</m> divides <m>(ax + by)</m>. 
      </p>
      
    </proof>
    </p>
    

    <p>
      We now let <m>a, b \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
      not both 0, and let <m>d = \gcd( {a, b} )</m>.
      <xref ref="T_gcdaslincomb"></xref>
      states that <m>d</m> can be written as a linear combination of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
      Now, since <m>d \mid a</m> and <m>d \mid b</m>,
      we can use the result of <xref ref="P_divlinearcomb"></xref>
      to conclude that for all <m>x,
      y \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>d \mid \left( {ax + by} \right)</m>.
      This means that <m>d</m> divides every linear combination of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
      In addition,
      this means that <m>d</m> must be the smallest positive number that is a linear combination 
      of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
      We summarize these results in <xref ref="T_gcddivideslincombs"></xref>.

    <p>
      Given nonzero integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
      we have seen that it is possible to use the Euclidean Algorithm to write their greatest 
      common divisor as a linear combination of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
      We have also seen that this can sometimes be a tedious,
      time-consuming process,
      which is why people have programmed computers to do this.
      Fortunately, in many proofs of number theory results,
      we do not actually have to construct this linear combination since simply knowing that it 
      exists can be useful in proving results.
      This will be illustrated in the proof of <xref ref="T_relativelyprimeprop"></xref>,
      which is based on work in <xref text="custom" ref="PA_exporingexamples">Beginning Activity 1</xref>.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="T_relativelyprimeprop">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a</m>,
          <m>b</m> be nonzero integers and let <m>c</m> be an integer.
          If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are relatively prime and
          <m>a \mid \left( {bc} \right)</m>, then <m>a \mid c</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      The explorations in <xref text="custom" ref="PA_exporingexamples">Beginning Activity 1</xref> were related to this theorem.
      We will first explore the forward-backward process for the proof.
      The goal is to prove that <m>a \mid c</m>.
      A standard way to do this is to prove that there exists an integer <m>q</m> such that
      <men xml:id="eq_relprime1">
        c = aq
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we are given that <m>a \mid \left( {bc} \right)</m>,
      there exists an integer <m>k</m> such that
      <men xml:id="eq_relprime2">
        bc = ak
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may seem tempting to divide both sides of equation <xref ref="eq_relprime2"/>
      by <m>b</m>,
      but if we do so,
      we run into problems with the fact that the integers are not closed under division.
      Instead, we look at the other part of the hypothesis,
      which is that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are relatively prime.
      This means that <m>\gcd( {a, b} ) = 1</m>.
      How can we use this?
      This means that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have no common factors except for 1.
      In light of equation <xref ref="eq_relprime2"/>
      it seems reasonable that any factor of <m>a</m> must also be a factor of <m>c</m>.
      But how do we formalize this?
    </p>
    <p>
      One conclusion that we can use is that since <m>\gcd( {a, b} ) = 1</m>,
      by <xref ref="T_relativelyprime"></xref>,
      there exist integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> such that
      <men xml:id="eq_relprime3">
        am + bn = 1
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may consider solving equation <xref ref="eq_relprime3"/> for <m>b</m> and 
      substituting this into equation <xref ref="eq_relprime2"/>
      The problem, again,
      is that in order to solve equation <xref ref="eq_relprime3"/> for <m>b</m>,
      we need to divide by <m>n</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before doing anything else,
      we should look at the goal in equation <xref ref="eq_relprime1"/>
      We need to introduce <m>c</m> into equation <xref ref="eq_relprime3"/>
      One way to do this is to multiply both sides of equation <xref ref="eq_relprime3"/> by <m>c</m>.
      (This keeps us in the system of integers since the integers are closed under multiplication.)
      This gives
      <mdn>
        <mrow number="no">\left( {am + bn} \right)c \amp = 1 \cdot c</mrow>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_relprime4">acm + bcn \amp = c</mrow>
      </mdn>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that the left side of equation <xref ref="eq_relprime4"/> contains a term,
      <m>bcn</m>, that contains <m>bc</m>.
      This means that we can use equation <xref ref="eq_relprime2"/> and substitute 
      <m>bc = ak</m> in equation <xref ref="eq_relprime4"/>.
      After doing this,
      we can factor the left side of the equation to prove that <m>a \mid c</m>.

      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> be integers.
          Assume that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are relatively prime and <m>a \mid ( {bc} )</m>.
          We will prove that <m>a</m> divides <m>c</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>a</m> divides <m>bc</m>,
          there exists an integer <m>k</m> such that
          <men xml:id="eq_814a">
            bc = ak
          </men>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition,
          we are assuming that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are relatively prime and hence 
          <m>\gcd ( {a, b} ) = 1</m>.
          So by <xref ref="T_gcddivideslincombs"></xref>,
          there exist integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> such that
          <men xml:id="eq_814b">
            am + bn = 1
          </men>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now multiply both sides of equation <xref ref="eq_814b"/> by <m>c</m>.
          This gives
          <mdn>
            <mrow number="no">( {am + bn} )c \amp = 1 \cdot c</mrow>
            <mrow xml:id="eq_814c">acm + bcn \amp = c</mrow>
          </mdn>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can now use equation 1 to substitute <m>bc = ak</m> in 
          equation <xref ref="eq_814c"/> and obtain
          <me>
            acm + akn = c
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we now factor the left side of this last equation,
          we see that <m>a( {cm + kn} ) = c</m>.
          Since <m>( {cm + kn} )</m> is an integer,
          this proves that <m>a</m> divides <m>c</m>.
          Hence, we have proven that if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are relatively prime and
          <m>a \mid ( {bc} )</m>, then <m>a \mid c</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Prime Numbers and Prime Factorizations</title>
    <p>
      We are now ready to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
      The first part of this theorem was proved in <xref ref="T_primefactors"></xref>
      in <xref ref="S_otherinduction"></xref>.
      This theorem states that each natural number greater than 1 is either a prime number or 
      is a product of prime numbers.
      Before we state the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic,
      we will discuss some notational conventions that will help us with the proof.
      We start with an example.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will use <m>n = 120</m>.
      Since <m>5 \mid 120</m>, we can write <m>120 = 5 \cdot 24</m>.
      In addition,
      we can factor 24 as <m>24 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3</m>.
      So we can write
      <md>
        <mrow>120 \amp = 5 \cdot 24</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = 5 \left( 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \right)</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a prime factorization of 120,
      but it is not the way we usually write this factorization.
      Most often, we will write the prime number factors in ascending order.
      So we write
      <me>
        120 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5\text{  or  } 120 = 2^3  \cdot 3 \cdot 5
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, let <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
      To write the prime factorization of <m>n</m> with the prime factors in ascending order 
      requires that if we write <m>n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r</m>,
      where <m>p_1 , p_2 , \ldots, p_r</m> are prime numbers,
      we will have <m>p_1 \leq p_2 \leq \cdots \leq p_r</m>.

            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    
    <proof>
      <p>
        The first part of this theorem was proved in <xref ref="T_primefactors"></xref>.
        We will prove the second part of the theorem by induction on <m>n</m> using the Second 
        Principle of Mathematical Induction.
        (See <xref ref="S_otherinduction"></xref>.)
        For each natural number <m>n</m> with <m>n > 1</m>, let <m>P( n )</m> be
        <blockquote>
          If <m>n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r</m> and <m>n = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_s</m>, where 
          <m>p_1 , p_2 , \ldots, p_r</m> and <m>q_1 , q_2 , \ldots, q_s</m> are primes with 
          <m>p_1 \leq p_2 \leq \cdots \leq p_r</m> and <m>q_1 \leq q_2 \leq \cdots \leq q_s</m>, 
          then <m>r = s</m>, and for each <m>j</m> from 1 to <m>r</m>, <m>p_j = q_j</m>.
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        For the basis step, we notice that since 2 is a prime number,
        its only factorization is <m>2 = 1 \cdot 2</m>.
        This means that the only equation of the form <m>2 = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r</m>,
        where <m>p_1 , p_2 , \ldots,
        p_r</m> are prime numbers, is the case where <m>r = 1</m> and <m>p_1 = 2</m>.
        This proves that <m>P( 2 )</m> is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the inductive step, let
        <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m> with <m>k \geq 2</m>.
        We will assume that
        <m>P( 2 ), P( 3 ), \ldots , P( k )</m> are true.
        The goal now is to prove that <m>P( {k + 1} )</m> is true.
        To prove this,
        we assume that <m>(k + 1)</m> has two prime factorizations and then prove that these 
        prime factorizations are the same.
        So we assume that
        <blockquote>
          <m>k + 1 = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r</m> and that <m>k + 1 = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_s</m>, where 
          <m>p_1 , p_2 , \ldots, p_r</m> and <m>q_1 , q_2 , \ldots, q_s</m> are primes with 
          <m>p_1 \leq p_2 \leq \cdots \leq p_r</m> and <m>q_1 \leq q_2 \leq \cdots \leq q_s</m>.
        </blockquote>

        We must now prove that <m>r = s</m>,
        and for each <m>j</m> from 1 to <m>r</m>, <m>p_j = q_j</m>.
        We can break our proof into two cases: (1) <m>p_1 \leq q_1</m>;
        and (2) <m>q_1 \leq p_1</m>.
        Since one of these must be true,
        and since the proofs will be similar, we can assume,
        without loss of generality, that <m>p_1 \leq q_1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>k + 1 = p_1 p_2  \cdots p_r</m>,
        we know that <m>p_1 \mid \left( {k + 1} \right)</m>,
        and hence we may conclude that <m>p_1 \mid \left( {q_1 q_2  \cdots q_s } \right)</m>.
        We now use <xref ref="C_primedivides"></xref>
        to conclude that there exists a <m>j</m> with
        <m>1 \leq j \leq s</m> such that <m>p_1 \mid q_j</m>.
        Since <m>p_1</m> and <m>q_j</m> are primes, we conclude that
        <me>
          p_1  = q_j
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have also assumed that <m>q_1  \leq q_j</m> for all <m>j</m> and, hence,
        we know that <m>q_1  \leq p_1</m>.
        However, we have also assumed that <m>p_1  \leq q_1</m>.
        Hence,
        <me>
          p_1  = q_1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now use this and the fact that <m>k + 1 = p_1 p_2  \cdots p_r  = q_1 q_2  \cdots q_s</m> 
        to conclude that
        <me>
          p_2  \cdots p_r  = q_2  \cdots q_s
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The product in the previous equation is less that <m>k + 1</m>.
        Hence, we can apply our induction hypothesis to these factorizations and conclude that <m>r = s</m>,
        and for each <m>j</m> from 2 to <m>r</m>, <m>p_j = q_j</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This completes the proof that if <m>P( 2 ), P( 3 ), \ldots , P( k )</m> are true,
        then <m>P( {k + 1} )</m> is true.
        Hence, by the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction,
        we conclude that <m>P( n )</m> is true for all
        <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m> with <m>n \geq 2</m>.
        This completes the proof of the theorem.

      Note: We often shorten the result of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic by simply 
      saying that each natural number greater than one that is not a prime has a
      <term>unique factorization</term>
          
      as a product of primes.
      This simply means that if <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
      <m>n > 1</m>, and <m>n</m> is not prime,
      then no matter how we choose to factor <m>n</m> into a product of primes,
      we will always have the same prime factors.
      The only difference may be in the order in which we write the prime factors.

        <title>The Number of Prime Numbers</title>
        <p>
          Prime numbers have fascinated mathematicians for centuries.
          For example,
          we can easily start writing a list of prime numbers in ascending order.
          Following is a list of the prime numbers less than 100.
          <blockquote>
            2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 
            79, 83, 89, 97
          </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
          This list contains the first 25 prime numbers.
          Does this list ever stop?
          The question was answered in <pubtitle>Euclid's Elements</pubtitle>,
          and the result is stated in <xref ref="T_infiniteprimes"></xref>.
          The proof of this theorem is considered to be one of the classical proofs by contradiction.
        </p>
        <theorem xml:id="T_infiniteprimes">
          <statement>
            <p>
              There are infinitely many prime numbers.
            </p>
          </statement>
        
        <proof>
          <p>
            We will use a proof by contradiction.
            We assume that there are only finitely many primes, and let
            <me>
              p_1 , p_2 ,  \ldots , p_m
            </me>
            be the list of all the primes.
            Let
            <men xml:id="T_infiniteprimes1">
              M = p_1 p_2  \cdots p_m  + 1
            </men>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notice that <m>M \ne 1</m>.
            So <m>M</m> is either a prime number or,
            by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic,
            <m>M</m> is a product of prime numbers.
            In either case, <m>M</m> has a factor that is a prime number.
            Since we have listed all the prime numbers,
            this means that there exists a natural number <m>j</m> with
            <m>1 \leq j \leq m</m> such that <m>p_j \mid  M</m>.
            Now, we can rewrite equation <xref ref="T_infiniteprimes1"/> as follows:
            <men xml:id="T_infiniteprimes2">
              1 = M - p_1 p_2  \cdots p_m
            </men>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have proved <m>p_j \mid M</m>,
            and since <m>p_j</m> is one of the prime factors of <m>p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m</m>,
            we can also conclude that <m>p_j \mid \left( {p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m } \right)</m>.
            Since <m>p_j</m> divides both of the terms on the right side of 
            equation <xref ref="T_infiniteprimes2"/>,
            we can use this equation to conclude that <m>p_j</m> divides 1.
            This is a contradiction since a prime number is greater than 1 and cannot divide 1.
            Hence, our assumption that there are only finitely many primes is false,
            and so there must be infinitely many primes.

        <p>
          There are infinitely many primes,
          but when we write a list of the prime numbers,
          we can see some long sequences of consecutive natural numbers that contain no prime numbers.
          For example, there are no prime numbers between 113 and 127.
          The following theorem shows that there exist arbitrarily long sequences of 
          consecutive natural numbers containing no prime numbers.

            By looking at the list of the first 25 prime numbers,
            we see several cases where consecutive prime numbers differ by 2.
            Examples are:  3  and  5;  11 and  13;  17 and  19; 29  and  31.
            Such pairs of prime numbers are said to be <term>twin primes</term>.
              
              
            How many twin primes exist?
            The answer is not known.
            The <term>Twin Prime Conjecture</term>
              
            states that there are infinitely many twin primes.
            As of June 25, 2010, this is still a conjecture as it has not been proved or disproved.

            Given an even natural number,
            is it possible to write it as a sum of two prime numbers?
            For example,

            One of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics is a conjecture made by 
            Christian Goldbach in a letter to Leonhard Euler in 1742.
            The conjecture,
            now known as <term>Goldbach's Conjecture</term>, is as follows:
            <blockquote>
              Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two 
              (not necessarily distinct) prime numbers.
            </blockquote>
          
          As of June 25, 2010, it is not known if this conjecture is true or false,
          although most mathematicians believe it to be true.

        The Twin Prime Conjecture states that there are infinitely many twin primes,
        but it is not known if this conjecture is true or false.
        The answers to the following questions,
        however, can be determined.

    <task>
      <p>
        How many pairs of primes <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> exist where <m>q - p = 3</m>?
        That is, how many pairs of primes are there that differ by 3?
        Prove that your answer is correct.
        (One such pair is 2 and 5.)

        How many triplets of primes of the form <m>p</m>,

        That is, how many triplets of primes exist where each prime is 2 more than the preceding 
        prime?
        Prove that your answer is correct.
        Notice that one such triplet is 3, 5, and 7.

    <title>Square Roots and Irrational Numbers</title>

      <introduction>
        <p>
          In <xref ref="C_proofs"></xref>,
          we proved that some square roots
          (such as <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>\sqrt{3}</m>)
          are irrational numbers.
          In this activity,
          we will use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to prove that if a natural number 
          is not a perfect square,
          then its square root is an irrational number.

          Let <m>n</m> be a natural number.
          Use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to explain why if <m>n</m> is composite,
