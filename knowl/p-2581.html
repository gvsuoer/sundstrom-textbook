<p>The Fibonacci numbers form a famous sequence in mathematics that was investigated by Leonardo of Pisa (1170 â€” 1250), who is better known as Fibonacci. Fibonacci introduced this sequence to the Western world as a solution of the following problem: <blockquote class="blockquote">Suppose that a pair of adult rabbits (one male, one female) produces a pair of rabbits (one male, one female) each month.  Also, suppose that newborn rabbits become adults in two months and produce another pair of rabbits.  Starting with one adult pair of rabbits, how many pairs of rabbits will be produced each month for one year?</blockquote></p>
