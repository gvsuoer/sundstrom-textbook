</h3>
<p>One of the primary goals of this book is to develop students' abilities to construct mathematical proofs. Another goal is to develop their abilities to write the proof in a coherent manner that conveys an understanding of the proof to the reader. These are two distinct skills.</p>
<p>Instruction on how to write proofs begins in <a href="S_1direct.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.2: Constructing Direct Proofs">Section 1.2</a> and is developed further in <a href="C_proofs.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics">Chapter 3</a>. In addition, <a href="C_induction.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: Mathematical Induction">Chapter 4</a> is devoted to developing students' abilities to construct proofs using mathematical induction. Students are introduced to a method to organize their thought processes when attempting to construct a proof that uses a so-called know-show table. (See <a href="S_1direct.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.2: Constructing Direct Proofs">Section 1.2</a> and <a href="S_directproof.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.1: Direct Proofs">Section 3.1</a>.) Students use this table to work backward from what it is they are trying to prove while at the same time working forward from the assumptions of the problem. The know-show tables are used quite extensively in <a href="C_1intro.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 1: Introduction to Writing Proofs in Mathematics">Chapter 1</a> and <a href="C_proofs.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics">Chapter 3</a>. However, the explicit use of know-show tables is gradually reduced and these tables are rarely used in the later chapters. One reason for this is that these tables may work well when there appears to be only one way of proving a certain result. As the proofs become more complicated or other methods of proof (such as proofs using cases) are used, these know-show tables become less useful.</p>
<p>So the know-show tables are not to be considered an absolute necessity in using the text. However, they are useful for students beginning to learn how to construct and write proofs. They provide a convenient way for students to organize their work. More importantly, they introduce students to a way of thinking about a problem. Instead of immediately trying to write a complete proof, the know-show table forces students to stop, think, and ask questions such as <blockquote class="blockquote">Just exactly what is it that I am trying to prove?</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">How can I prove this?</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">What methods do I have that may allow me to prove this?</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">What are the assumptions?</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">How can I use these assumptions to prove the result?</blockquote> Being able to ask these questions is a big step in constructing a proof. The next task is to answer the questions and to use those answers to construct a proof.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="fm-preface.html#li-31" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
