<p>In this case, the “element” is an integer, the “given property” is that it is an element of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> and the “something that happens” is that the element is also an element of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> One way to approach this is to create a list of all elements with the given property and verify that for each one, the “something happens.” When the list is short, this may be a reasonable approach. However, as in this case, when the list is infinite (or even just plain long), this approach is not practical.</p>
