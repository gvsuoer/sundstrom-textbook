      <title><em>Set Operations</em></title>
      <p>
        Before beginning this section,
        it would be a good idea to review sets and set notation,
        including the roster method and set builder notation,
        in <xref ref="S_predicates">Section</xref>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="S_logop">Section</xref>,
        we used logical operators (conjunction, disjunction,
        negation) to form new statements from existing statements.
        In a similar manner,
        there are several ways to create new sets from sets that have already been defined.
        In fact, we will form these new sets using the logical operators of conjunction (and),
        disjunction (or), and negation
        (not).
        For example,
        if the universal set is the set of natural numbers <m>\N</m> and
        <me>
          A = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \} \qquad \text{ and }  \qquad B = \{ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 \}
        </me>,
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The set consisting of all natural numbers that are in <m>A</m> and are in <m>B</m> is the set <m>\{1, 3, 5 \}</m>;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The set consisting of all natural numbers that are in <m>A</m> or are in <m>B</m> is the set <m>\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 \}</m>; and
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The set consisting of all natural numbers that are in <m>A</m> and are not in <m>B</m> is the set <m>\{ 2, 4, 6 \}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        These sets are examples of some of the most common set operations,
        which are given in the following definitions.

            </me>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
      <p>
        For the rest of this beginning activity,
        the universal set is <m>U = \left\{ {0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots , 10} \right\}</m>,
        and we will use the following subsets of <m>U</m>:
        <m>A = \left\{ {0, 1, 2, 3, 9} \right\}</m> and <m>B = \left\{ {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} \right\}</m>.
        So in this case,
        <m>A \cap B = \left\{ {x \in U} \mid {x \in A \text{ and } x \in B} \right\} = \{2, 3 \}</m>.
        Use the roster method to specify each of the following subsets of <m>U</m>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>A \cup B</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>A^c</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>B^c</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        We can now use these sets to form even more sets.
        For example,
        <me>
          A \cap B^c = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 9 \} \cap \{0, 1, 7, 8, 9, 10 \} = \{0, 1, 9 \}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the roster method to specify each of the following subsets of <m>U</m>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>A \cup B^c</m>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>A^c \cap B^c</m>

            <p>
              <m>A^c \cup B^c</m>

      <title><em>Venn Diagrams for Two Sets</em></title>
      <p>
        In Beginning <xref ref="PA_setops">Activity</xref>,
        we worked with verbal and symbolic definitions of set operations.
        However, it is also helpful to have a visual representation of sets.
        <term>Venn diagrams</term> are used to
            <idx><h>Venn diagram</h></idx>
        represent sets by circles
        (or some other closed geometric shape)
        drawn inside a rectangle.
        The points inside the rectangle represent the universal set <m>U</m>,
        and the elements of a set are represented by the points inside the circle that represents the set.
        For example, <xref ref="fig_venn2-prev">Figure</xref>
        is a Venn diagram showing two sets.
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig_venn2-prev">
        <caption>Venn Diagram for Two Sets</caption>
        <image width="73%" source="images/figps-venn2.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="fig_venn2-prev">Figure</xref>,
        the elements of <m>A</m> are represented by the points inside the left circle,
        and the elements of <m>B</m> are represented by the points inside the right circle.
        The four distinct regions in the diagram are numbered for reference purposes only.
        (The numbers do not represent elements in a set.)
        The following table describes the four regions in the diagram.
        <me>
          <tabular>
            <row>
              <cell>" Region  "  Elements of \(U\)  "   Set  "</cell>
            </row>
            <row>
              <cell>_ "1  "  In \(A\) and not in \(B\)  "  \(A - B\)  "</cell>

          </tabular>
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We can use these regions to represent other sets.
        For example,
        the set <m>A \cup B</m> is represented by regions 1, 2, and 3 or the shaded region in <xref ref="fig_union2">Figure</xref>.

        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be subsets of a universal set <m>U</m>.
        For each of the following,
        draw a Venn diagram for two sets and shade the region that represent the specified set.
        In addition, describe the set using set builder notation.

  <subsection xml:id="ss_propersubset">
    <title>Set Equality, Subsets, and Proper Subsets</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="S_predicates">Section</xref>,
      we introduced some basic definitions used in set theory,
      what it means to say that two sets are equal and what it means to say that one set is a subset of another set.
      See the definitions on <xref ref="D_setequality">page</xref>.
      We need one more definition.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="propersubset">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two sets contained in some universal set <m>U</m>.
          The set <m>A</m> is a <term>proper subset</term>
              <idx><h>proper subset</h></idx>
              <idx><h>subset</h><h>proper</h></idx>
          of <m>B</m> provided that <m>A \subseteq B</m> and <m>A \ne B</m>.
          When <m>A</m> is a proper subset of <m>B</m>,
          we write <m>A \subset B</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      One reason for the definition of proper subset is that each set is a subset of itself.
      That is, If <m>A</m> is a set,
      then <m>A \subseteq A</m>.
      However, sometimes we need to indicate that a set <m>X</m> is a subset of <m>Y</m> but <m>X \ne Y</m>.
      For example, if
      <me>
        X = \left\{ {1, 2} \right\}\text{  and  } Y = \left\{ {0, 1, 2, 3} \right\}\!
      </me>,
      then <m>X \subset Y</m>.
      We know that <m>X \subseteq Y</m> since each element of <m>X</m> is an element of <m>Y</m>,
      but <m>X \ne Y</m> since <m>0 \in Y</m> and <m>0 \notin X</m>.
      (Also, <m>3 \in Y</m> and <m>3 \notin X</m>.)
      Notice that the notations <m>A \subset B</m> and
      <m>A \subseteq B</m> are used in a manner similar to inequality notation for numbers
      (<m>a \lt  b</m> and <m>a \leq b</m>).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is often very important to be able to describe precisely what it means to say that one set is not a subset of the other.
      In the preceding example,
      <m>Y</m> is not a subset of <m>X</m> since there exists an element of <m>Y</m> (namely, 0) that is not in <m>X</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, the subset relation is described with the use of a universal quantifier since
      <m>A \subseteq B</m> means that for each element <m>x</m> of <m>U</m>,
      if <m>x \in A</m>, then <m>x \in B</m>.
      So when we negate this, we use an existential quantifier as follows:
    </p>
    <tabular>
      <row>
        <cell><m>A \subseteq B</m></cell>
        <cell>means</cell>
        <cell><m>\left( {\forall x \in U} \right)\left[ {\left( {x \in A} \right) \to \left( {x \in B} \right)} \right]</m>.</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell></cell>
        <cell></cell>
        <cell></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><m>A \not\subseteq B</m></cell>
        <cell>means</cell>
        <cell><m>\mynot  \left( {\forall x \in U} \right)\left[ {\left( {x \in A} \right) \to \left( {x \in B} \right)} \right]</m></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell></cell>
        <cell></cell>
        <cell><m>\left( {\exists x \in U} \right) \mynot  \left[ {\left( {x \in A} \right) \to \left( {x \in B} \right)} \right]</m></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell></cell>
        <cell></cell>
        <cell><m>\left( {\exists x \in U} \right)\left[ {\left( {x \in A} \right) \wedge \left( {x \notin B} \right)} \right]</m>.</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>
    <p>
      So we see that <m>A \not\subseteq B</m> means that there exists an <m>x</m> in <m>U</m> such that <m>x \in A</m> and <m>x \notin B</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that if <m>A = \emptyset</m>,
      then the conditional statement,
      <q>For each <m>x \in U</m>, if
      <m>x \in \emptyset</m>, then <m>x \in B</m></q>
      must be true since the hypothesis will always be false.
      Another way to look at this is to consider the following statement:
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>\emptyset \not \subseteq B</m> means that there exists an
      <m>x \in \emptyset</m> such that <m>x \notin B</m>.
      However, this statement must be false since there does not exist an <m>x</m> in <m>\emptyset</m>.
      Since this is false,
      we must conclude that <m>\emptyset \subseteq B</m>.
      Although the facts that <m>\emptyset \subseteq B</m> and
      <m>B \subseteq B</m> may not seem very important,
      we will use these facts later,
      and hence we summarize them in <xref ref="T_subsets">Theorem</xref>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_subsets">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any set <m>B</m>,
          <m>\emptyset \subseteq B</m> and <m>B \subseteq B</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="S_predicates">Section</xref>,
      we also defined two sets to be equal when they have precisely the same elements.
      For example,
      <me>
        \left\{ {\left. {x \in \mathbb{R}\,} \right|\;x^2  = 4} \right\} = \left\{ { - 2,\;2} \right\}\!
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are equal,
      then it must be true that every element of <m>A</m> is an element of <m>B</m>,
      that is, <m>A \subseteq B</m>,
      and it must be true that every element of <m>B</m> is an element of <m>A</m>,
      that is, <m>B \subseteq A</m>.
      Conversely, if <m>A \subseteq B</m> and <m>B \subseteq A</m>,
      then <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must have precisely the same elements.
      This gives us the following test for set equality:

    <title>More about Venn Diagrams</title>
    <p>
      In Beginning <xref ref="PA_venn">Activity</xref>,
      we learned how to use Venn diagrams as a visual representation for sets,
      set operations, and set relationships.
      In that activity, we restricted ourselves to using two sets.
      We can, of course, include more than two sets in a Venn diagram.
      <xref ref="fig_aintersectc">Figure</xref>
      shows a general Venn diagram for three sets
      (including a shaded region that corresponds to <m>A \cap C</m>).
    </p>
    <p>
      In this diagram, there are eight distinct regions,
      and each region has a unique reference number.
      For example,
      the set <m>A</m> is represented by the combination of regions 1, 2, 4, and 5, whereas the set <m>C</m> is represented by the combination of regions 4, 5, 6, and 7.
      This means that the set <m>A \cap C</m> is represented by the combination of regions 4 and 5.
      This is shown as the shaded region in <xref ref="fig_aintersectc">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_aintersectc">
      <caption>Venn Diagram for <m>A \cap C</m></caption>
      <image width="73%" source="images/figps-ainterc3.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Finally, Venn diagrams can also be used to illustrate special relationships between sets.
      For example, if <m>A \subseteq B</m>,
      then the circle representing <m>A</m> should be completely contained in the circle for <m>B</m>.
      So if <m>A \subseteq B</m>,
      and we know nothing about any relationship between the set <m>C</m> and the sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
      we could use the Venn diagram shown in <xref ref="fig_asubsetb">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <title>The Power Set of a Set</title>
    <p>
      The symbol <m>\in</m> is used to describe a relationship between an element of the universal set and a subset of the universal set,
      and the symbol <m>\subseteq</m> is used to describe a relationship between two subsets of the universal set.
      For example, the number 5 is an integer,
      and so it is appropriate to write <m>5 \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
      It is not appropriate, however,
      to write <m>5 \subseteq \mathbb{Z}</m> since 5 is not a set.
      It is important to distinguish between 5 and <m>\left\{ 5 \right\}</m>.
      The difference is that 5 is an integer and
      <m>\left\{ 5 \right\}</m> is a set consisting of one element.
      Consequently,
      it is appropriate to write <m>\left\{ 5 \right\} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}</m>,
      but it is not appropriate to write <m>\left\{ 5 \right\} \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
      The distinction between these two symbols
      <m>\left( 5 \text{ and } \left\{ 5 \right\} \right)</m> is important when we discuss what is called the power set of a given set.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="D_powerset">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> is a subset of a universal set <m>U</m>,
          then the set whose members are all the subsets of <m>A</m> is called the <term>power set</term>
              <idx><h>power set</h></idx>
              <idx><h>set</h><h>power</h></idx>
          of <m>A</m>.
          We denote the power set of <m>A</m> by
          <m>\mathcal{P}( A )</m> . Symbolically, we write
          <me>
            \mathcal{P}( A ) = \left\{ {X \subseteq U  \mid X \subseteq A} \right\}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is, <m>X \in \mathcal{P}( A )</m> if and only if <m>X \subseteq A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      When dealing with the power set of <m>A</m>,
      we must always remember that
      <m>\emptyset  \subseteq A</m> and <m>A \subseteq A</m>.
      For example, if <m>A = \left\{ {a,b} \right\}</m>,
      then the subsets of <m>A</m> are
      <men xml:id="eq_subsets2">
        \emptyset,\left\{ a \right\}\!,\left\{ b \right\}\!,\left\{ {a,b} \right\}\!
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can write this as
      <me>
        \mathcal{P}( A ) = \left\{ {\emptyset,\left\{ a \right\}\!,\left\{ b \right\}\!,\left\{ {a,b} \right\}} \right\}\!
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let <m>B = \left\{ {a, b, c} \right\}</m>.
      Notice that <m>B = A \cup \{ c \}</m>.
      We can determine the subsets of <m>B</m> by starting with the subsets of <m>A</m> in<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_subsets2"/>.
      We can form the other subsets of <m>B</m> by taking the union of each set in<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_subsets2"/> with the set <m>\{c \}</m>.
      This gives us the following subsets of <m>B</m>.
      <men xml:id="eq_subsets2a">
        \{ c \},\left\{ a, c \right\}\!,\left\{ b, c \right\}\!,\left\{ {a,b, c} \right\}\!
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the subsets of <m>B</m> are those sets in<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_subsets2"/> combined with those sets in<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_subsets2a"/>.
      That is, the subsets of <m>B</m> are
      <men xml:id="eq_subsets2b">
        \emptyset,\left\{ a \right\}\!,\left\{ b \right\}\!,\left\{ {a,b} \right\}, \{ c \},\left\{ a, c \right\}\!,\left\{ b, c \right\}\!,\left\{ {a,b, c} \right\}\!
      </men>,
      which means that
      <me>
        \mathcal{P}( B ) = \left\{ {\emptyset,\left\{ a \right\}\!, \left\{ b \right\}\!, \left\{ {a, b} \right\}\!,\left\{ c \right\}\!,\left\{ {a,c} \right\}\!,\left\{ {b,c} \right\}\!,\left\{ {a,b,c} \right\}} \right\}\!
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that we could write
      <me>
        \left\{ {a,c} \right\} \subseteq B \text{  or that  } \left\{ {a,c} \right\} \in \mathcal{P}( B )
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, notice that <m>A</m> has two elements and <m>A</m> has four subsets,
      and <m>B</m> has three elements and <m>B</m> has eight subsets.
      Now, let <m>n</m> be a nonnegative integer.
      The following result can be proved using mathematical induction.
      (See <xref ref="exer_powerset">Exercise</xref>.)
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_powerset">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n</m> be a nonnegative integer and let <m>T</m> be a subset of some universal set.
          If the set <m>T</m> has <m>n</m> elements,
          then the set <m>T</m> has <m>2^n</m> subsets.
          That is, <m>\mathcal{P}(T)</m> has <m>2^n</m> elements.

    <title>The Cardinality of a Finite Set</title>
    <p>
      In our discussion of the power set,
      we were concerned with the number of elements in a set.
      In fact, the number of elements in a finite set is a distinguishing characteristic of the set,
      so we give it the following name.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="D_cardinality">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The number of elements in a finite set <m>A</m> is called the <term>cardinality</term>
              <idx><h>cardinality</h></idx>
              <idx><h>cardinality</h><h>finite set</h></idx>
          of <m>A</m> and is denoted by <m>\card(A)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      For example, <m>\card (\emptyset) = 0</m>;
      <m>\card (\left\{ {a,b} \right\}) = 2</m>;
      <m>\card \left( \mathcal{P}( \left\{ {a,b} \right\}) \right) = 4</m>.
    </p>
    <em>Theoretical Note:</em>  There is a mathematical way to distinguish between finite and infinite sets, and there is a way to define the cardinality of an infinite set.  We will not concern ourselves with this at this time.  More about the cardinality of finite and infinite sets is discussed in <xref ref="C_topicsinsets">Chapter</xref>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Standard Number Systems</title>
    <p>
      We can use set notation to specify and help describe our standard number systems.
      The starting point is the set of
      <em>natural numbers</em>,
          <idx><h>natural numbers</h></idx>
      for which we use the roster method.
      <me>
        \N = \left\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \;\right\}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>integers</em>
          <idx><h>integers</h></idx>
      consist of the natural numbers,
      the negatives of the natural numbers, and zero.
      If we let <m>\N^- = \left\{ \ldots, -4, -3, -2, -1 \right\}</m>,
      then we can use set union and write
      <me>
        \Z = \N^- \cup \left\{ 0 \right\} \cup \N
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we see that <m>\N \subseteq \Z</m>,
      and in fact, <m>\N \subset \Z</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need to use set builder notation for the set <m>\Q</m> of all
      <em>rational numbers</em>,
      which consists of quotients of integers.
      <me>
        \Q = \left\{ \left. \frac{m}{n}  \right| m, n \in \Z \text{ and }  n \ne 0 \right\}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since any integer <m>n</m> can be written as <m>n = \dfrac{n}{1}</m>,
      we see that <m>\Z \subseteq \Q</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not yet have the tools to give a complete description of the real numbers.
          <idx><h>real numbers</h></idx>
      We will simply say that the <em>real numbers</em>
      consist of the rational numbers and the
      <em>irrational numbers</em>.
      In effect, the irrational numbers are the complement of the set of rational numbers <m>\Q</m> in <m>\R</m>.
      So
          <idx><h>irrational numbers</h></idx>
      we can use the notation <m>\Q^c = \left\{ x \in \R \mid x \notin \Q \right\}</m> and write
      <me>
        \R = \Q \cup \Q^c \qquad \text{ and }  \qquad \Q \cap \Q^c = \emptyset
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number system that we have not yet discussed is the set of
      <em>complex numbers</em>.
          <idx><h>complex numbers</h></idx>
      The complex numbers, <m>\C</m>,
      consist of all numbers of the form <m>a + bi</m>, where
      <m>a,
      b \in \R</m> and <m>i = \sqrt{-1}</m>
      (or <m>i^2 = -1</m>).
      That is,
      <me>
        \C = \left\{  a + bi \left|  a, b \in \R \text{ and }  i = \sqrt{-1} \right. \right\}\!
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can add and multiply complex numbers as follows: If <m>a,
      b, c, d \in \R</m>, then
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}\left( a + bi \right) + \left( c + di \right) \amp = \left(a + c \right) + \left(b + d \right)i, \text{ and }  \\ \left( a + bi \right) \left( c + di \right) \amp = ac + adi + bci + bdi^2 \\ \amp = \left(ac - bd \right) + \left(ad + bc \right)i. \end{aligned}

          To help with the proof by induction of <xref ref="T_powerset">Theorem</xref>,
          we first prove the following lemma.
          (The idea for the proof of this lemma was illustrated with the discussion of power set after the definition on <xref ref="D_powerset">page</xref>.)

                Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be subsets of some universal set.
                If <m>A = B \cup \left\{ x \right\}</m>, where <m>x \notin B</m>,

                where <m>C</m> is a subset of <m>B</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>
          </lemma>
          <proof>
            <p>
              Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be subsets of some universal set,
              and assume that <m>A = B \cup \left\{ x \right\}</m> where <m>x \notin B</m>.
              Let <m>Y</m> be a subset of <m>A</m>.
              We need to show that <m>Y</m> is a subset of <m>B</m> or that <m>Y = C \cup \left\{ x \right\}</m>,
              where <m>C</m> is some subset of <m>B</m>.
              There are two cases to consider: (1) <m>x</m> is not an element of <m>Y</m>,
              and (2) <m>x</m> is an element of <m>Y</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Case 1</em>: Assume that <m>x \notin Y</m>.
              Let <m>y \in Y</m>.
              Then <m>y \in A</m> and <m>y \ne x</m>.
              Since
              <me>
                A = B \cup \left\{ x \right\}\!
              </me>,
              this means that <m>y</m> must be in <m>B</m>.
              Therefore, <m>Y \subseteq B</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Case 2</em>: Assume that <m>x \in Y</m>.
              In this case, let <m>C = Y - \left\{ x \right\}</m>.
              Then every element of <m>C</m> is an element of <m>B</m>.
              Hence, we can conclude that
              <m>C \subseteq B</m> and that <m>Y = C \cup \left\{ x \right\}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cases (1) and (2) show that if <m>Y \subseteq A</m>,
              then <m>Y \subseteq B</m> or <m>Y = C \cup \left\{ x \right\}</m>, where

          To begin the induction proof of <xref ref="T_powerset">Theorem</xref>,
          for each nonnegative integer <m>n</m>, we let <m>P ( n )</m> be,
          <q>If   a finite set has exactly <m>n</m>  elements,
          then  that set  has exactly  <m>2^n</m> subsets.</q>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Verify that <m>P ( 0 )</m> is true.
                (This is the basis step for the induction proof.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Verify that <m>P( 1 )</m> and <m>P( 2 )</m> are true.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Now assume that <m>k</m> is a nonnegative integer and assume that <m>P( k )</m> is true.
                That is, assume that if a set has <m>k</m> elements,
                then that set has <m>2^k</m> subsets.
                (This is the inductive assumption for the induction proof.)
                Let <m>T</m> be a subset of the universal set with
                <m>\card (T) = k + 1</m>, and let <m>x \in T</m>.
                Then the set <m>B = T - \left\{ x \right\}</m> has <m>k</m> elements.
                Now use the inductive assumption to determine how many subsets <m>B</m> has.
                Then use <xref ref="L_inductivestepforsubsets">Lemma</xref>
                to prove that <m>T</m> has twice as many subsets as <m>B</m>.
                This should help complete the inductive step for the induction proof.
