<p>Each natural number greater than 1 either is a prime number or is a product of prime numbers.</p></article><article class="proof"><h4 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h4>
<p>We will use the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction. We let <span class="process-math">\(P( n )\)</span> be <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is a prime number or <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is a product of prime numbers.</p>
<p>For the basis step, <span class="process-math">\(P ( 2 )\)</span> is true since 2 is a prime number.</p>
<p>To prove the inductive step, we let <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> be a natural number with <span class="process-math">\(k \geq 2\text{.}\)</span> We assume that <span class="process-math">\(P( 2 ),P( 3 ), \ldots ,P( k )\)</span> are true. That is, we assume that each of the natural numbers <span class="process-math">\(2,3, \ldots ,k\)</span> is a prime number or a product of prime numbers. The goal is to prove that <span class="process-math">\(P( {k + 1} )\)</span> is true or that <span class="process-math">\((k + 1)\)</span> is a prime number or a product of prime numbers.</p>
<p>Case 1: If <span class="process-math">\(\left( {k + 1} \right)\)</span> is a prime number, then <span class="process-math">\(P( {k + 1} )\)</span> is true.</p>
<p>Case 2: If <span class="process-math">\(\left( {k + 1} \right)\)</span> is not a prime number, then <span class="process-math">\(\left( {k + 1} \right)\)</span> can be factored into a product of natural numbers with each one being less than <span class="process-math">\(\left( {k + 1} \right)\text{.}\)</span> That is, there exist natural numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> with</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
k + 1 = a \cdot b,  \text{ and }   1 \lt  a \leq k \text{ and }   1 \lt  b \leq k\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Using the inductive assumption, this means that <span class="process-math">\(P( a )\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P( b )\)</span> are both true. Consequently, <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are prime numbers or are products of prime numbers. Since <span class="process-math">\(k + 1 = a \cdot b\text{,}\)</span> we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\left( {k + 1} \right)\)</span> is a product of prime numbers. That is, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(P\left( {k + 1} \right)\)</span> is true. This proves the inductive step.</p>
<p>Hence, by the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(P( n )\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(n \geq 2\text{,}\)</span> and this means that each natural number greater than 1 is either a prime number or is a product of prime numbers.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_otherinduction.html#T_primefactors" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
