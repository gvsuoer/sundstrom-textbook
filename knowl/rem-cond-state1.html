<p>The conventions for the truth value of conditional statements may seem a bit strange, especially the fact that the conditional statement is true when the hypothesis of the conditional statement is false. The following example is meant to show that this makes sense.</p>
<p>Suppose that Ed has exactly $52 in his wallet. The following four statements will use the four possible truth combinations for the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>If Ed has exactly $52 in his wallet, then he has at least $20 in his wallet. This is a true statement. Notice that both the hypothesis and the conclusion are true.</p></li>
<li><p>If Ed has exactly $52 in his wallet, then he has $100 in his wallet. This statement is false. Notice that the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.</p></li>
<li><p>If Ed has $100 in his wallet, then he has at least $50 in his wallet. This statement is true regardless of how much money he has in his wallet. In this case, the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true.</p></li>
<li><p>If Ed has $100 in his wallet, then he has at least $80 in his wallet. This statement is true regardless of how much money he has in his wallet. In this case, the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is false.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><p>This is admittedly a contrived example but it does illustrate that the conventions for the truth value of a conditional statement make sense. The message is that in order to be complete in mathematics, we need to have conventions about when a conditional statement is true and when it is false.</p></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1prop.html#rem-cond-state1" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
