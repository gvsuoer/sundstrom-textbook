<p>Answering a backward question can sometimes be tricky. If the goal is the statement  <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> we must construct the know-show table so that if we know that  <span class="process-math">\(Q1\)</span> is true, then we can conclude that <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true. It is sometimes easy to answer this in a way that if it is known that  <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true, then we can conclude that <span class="process-math">\(Q1\)</span> is true. For example, suppose the goal is to prove</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
y^2 = 4\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where  <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>  is a real number. A backward question could be, “How do we prove the square of a real number equals four?” One possible answer is to prove that the real number equals 2. Another way is to prove that the real number equals <span class="process-math">\(-2\text{.}\)</span> This is an appropriate backward question, and these are appropriate answers.</p>
<p>However, if the goal is to prove</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
y = 2\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where  <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>  is a real number, we could ask, “How do we prove a real number equals 2?” It is not appropriate to answer this question with “prove that the square of the real number equals 4.” This is because if <span class="process-math">\(y^2=4\text{,}\)</span> then it is not necessarily true that <span class="process-math">\(y=2\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1direct.html#li-76" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
