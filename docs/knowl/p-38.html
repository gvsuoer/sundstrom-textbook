<p>Mathematical content is needed as a vehicle for learning how to construct and write proofs. The mathematical content for this text is drawn primarily from elementary number theory, including congruence arithmetic; elementary set theory; functions including injections, surjections, and the inverse of a function; relations and equivalence relations; topics in number theory such as greatest common divisors and prime factorizations; and finite and infinite sets. This material was chosen because it can be used to illustrate a broad range of proof techniques and it is needed as a prerequisite for many upper-level mathematics courses. The chapters in the text can roughly be divided into the following categories:</p>
