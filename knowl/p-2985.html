<p>The method of proof we will use in this section can be called the <dfn class="terminology">choose-an-element method.</dfn> This method was introduced in <a href="S_provingset.html#PA_working2sets" class="internal" title="Beginning Activity: Beginning Activity 1: Working with Two Specific Sets">Beginning Activity 1</a>. This method is frequently used when we encounter a universal quantifier in a statement in the backward process. This statement often has the form <blockquote class="blockquote">For each element with a given property, something happens.</blockquote> Since most statements with a universal quantifier can be expressed in the form of a conditional statement, this statement could have the following equivalent form: <blockquote class="blockquote">If an element has a given property, then something happens.</blockquote> We will illustrate this with the proposition from <a href="S_provingset.html#PA_working2sets" class="internal" title="Beginning Activity: Beginning Activity 1: Working with Two Specific Sets">Beginning Activity 1</a>. This proposition can be stated as follows: <blockquote class="blockquote">Let S be the set of all integers that are multiples of 6, and let T be the set of all even integers. Then S is a subset of T.</blockquote> In <a href="S_provingset.html#PA_working2sets" class="internal" title="Beginning Activity: Beginning Activity 1: Working with Two Specific Sets">Beginning Activity 1</a>, we worked on a know-show table for this proposition. The key was that in the backward process, we encountered the following statement: <blockquote class="blockquote">Each element of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is an element of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> or, more precisely, if <span class="process-math">\(x \in S\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(x \in T\text{.}\)</span>
