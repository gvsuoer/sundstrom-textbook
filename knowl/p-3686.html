<p> Every point on this graph corresponds to an ordered pair <span class="process-math">\(\left( {x,\;y} \right)\)</span> of real numbers, where <span class="process-math">\(y = g( x ) = x^2  - 2x - 1\text{.}\)</span> Because we use the Cartesian plane when drawing this type of graph, we can only use this type of graph when both the domain and the codomain of the function are subsets of the real numbers <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{.}\)</span> Such a function is sometimes called a <dfn class="terminology">real function</dfn>. The graph of a real function is a visual way to communicate information about the function. For example, the range of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is the set of all <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-values that correspond to points on the graph. In this case, the graph of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is a parabola and has a vertex at the point <span class="process-math">\((1, -2)\text{.}\)</span> (Note: The <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-coordinate of the vertex can be found by using calculus and solving the equation <span class="process-math">\(f ' (x) = 0\text{.}\)</span>) Since the graph of the function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is a parabola, we know that the pattern shown on the left end and the right end of the graph continues and we can conclude that the range of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is the set of all <span class="process-math">\(y \in \R\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(y \geq -2\text{.}\)</span> That is,</p>
