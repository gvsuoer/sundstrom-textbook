<p>In order for the set of natural numbers to be closed under subtraction, the following conditional statement would have to be true: If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are natural numbers, then <span class="process-math">\(x - y\)</span> is a natural number. However, since 5 and 8 are natural numbers, <span class="process-math">\(5 - 8 = -3\text{,}\)</span> which is not a natural number, this conditional statement is false. Therefore, the set of natural numbers is not closed under subtraction.</p>
<p>We can use the rules for multiplying fractions and the closure rules for the integers to show that the rational numbers are closed under multiplication. If <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{a}{b}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{c}{d}\)</span> are rational numbers (so <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> are integers and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> are not zero), then</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since the integers are closed under multiplication, we know that <span class="process-math">\(ac\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(bd\)</span> are integers and since <span class="process-math">\(b \ne 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d \ne 0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(bd \ne 0\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{ac}{bd}\)</span> is a rational number and this shows that the rational numbers are closed under multiplication.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1prop.html#ex_closure">in-context</a></span>
