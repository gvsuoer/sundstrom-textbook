  <title>Injections, Surjections, and Bijections</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Functions are frequently used in mathematics to define and describe certain relationships between sets and other mathematical objects.
      In addition,
      functions can be used to impose certain mathematical structures on sets.
      In this section,
      we will study special types of functions that are used to describe these relationships that are called injections and surjections.
      Before defining these types of functions,
      we will revisit what the definition of a function tells us and explore certain functions with finite domains.

      <title>Functions with Finite Domains</title>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets.
        Given a function <m>f\x A \to B</m>, we know the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              For every <m>x \in A</m>, <m>f( x ) \in B</m>.
              That is, every element of <m>A</m> is an input for the function <m>f</m>.
              This could also be stated as follows: For each <m>x \in A</m>,
              there exists a <m>y \in B</m> such that <m>y = f( x )</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For a given <m>x \in A</m>,
              there is exactly one <m>y \in B</m> such that <m>y = f( x )</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The definition of a function does not require that different inputs produce different outputs.
        That is, it is possible to have <m>x_1 , x_2 \in A</m> with
        <m>x_1 \ne x_2</m> and <m>f( {x_1 } ) = f( {x_2 } )</m>.
        The arrow diagram for the function <m>f</m> in <xref ref="fig_arrow63-1new">Figure</xref> illustrates such a function.
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig_arrow63-1new">
        <caption>Arrow Diagram for Two Functions</caption>
        <image width="73%" source="images/figps-arrow63-1new.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Also, the definition of a function does not require that the range of the function must equal the codomain.
        The range is always a subset of the codomain,
        but these two sets are not required to be equal.
        That is, if <m>g\x A \to B</m>,
        then it is possible to have a <m>y \in B</m> such that
        <m>g( x ) \ne y</m> for all <m>x \in A</m>.
        The arrow diagram for the function <m>g</m> in <xref ref="fig_arrow63-1new">Figure</xref> illustrates such a function.

    <title>Injections</title>
    <p>
      In previous sections and in <xref ref="PA_functionswithfinitedom"></xref>,
      we have seen examples of functions for which there exist different inputs that produce the same output.
      Using more formal notation,
      this means that there are functions
      <m>f:A \to B</m> for which there exist \mbox{<m>x_1 , x_2 \in A</m>} with
      <m>x_1 \ne x_2</m> and <m>f( {x_1 } ) = f( {x_2 } )</m>.
      The work in the beginning activities was intended to motivate the following definition.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="injection">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f:A \to B</m> be a function from the set <m>A</m> to the set <m>B</m>.
          The function <m>f</m> is called an <term>injection</term>
              <idx><h>injection</h></idx>
          provided that for all <m>x_1 , x_2 \in A</m>,
          if <m>x_1 \ne x_2</m>, then <m>f( {x_1 } ) \ne f( {x_2 } )</m>.
          When <m>f</m> is an injection,
          we also say that <m>f</m> is a <term>one-to-one function</term>,
              <idx><h>one-to-one function</h></idx>
              <idx><h>function</h><h>one-to-one</h></idx>
          or that <m>f</m> is an <term>injective function</term>.
              <idx><h>function</h><h>injective</h></idx>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Notice that the condition that specifies that a function <m>f</m> is an injection is given in the form of a conditional statement.
      As we shall see, in proofs,
      it is usually easier to use the contrapositive of this conditional statement.
      Although we did not define the term then,
      we have already written the contrapositive for the conditional statement in the definition of an injection in Part<nbsp/><xref ref="PA_functionstatements1"/> of <xref ref="PA_functionstatements"></xref>.
      In that activity,
      we also wrote the negation of the definition of an injection.
      Following is a summary of this work giving the conditions for <m>f</m> being an injection or not being an injection.

      <em>Let </em> <m>\boldsymbol{f\x A \to B}</m>.

      <title>Working with the Definition of an Injection</title>

    <title>Surjections</title>
    <p>
      In previous sections and in <xref ref="PA_functionswithfinitedom"></xref>,
      we have seen that there exist functions
      <m>f\x A \to B</m> for which <m>\text{ range } (f) = B</m>.
      This means that every element of <m>B</m> is an output of the function <m>f</m> for some input from the set <m>A</m>.
      Using quantifiers, this means that for every <m>y \in B</m>,
      there exists an <m>x \in A</m> such that
      <m>f( x ) = y</m> . One of the objectives of the beginning activities was to motivate the following definition.

      One of the conditions that specifies that a function <m>f</m> is a surjection is given in the form of a universally quantified statement,
      which is the primary statement used in proving a function is
      (or is not)
      a surjection.

      we have already written the negation for the statement defining a surjection in Part<nbsp/><xref ref="PA_functionstatements2"/> of <xref ref="PA_functionstatements"></xref>.

      One other important type of function is when a function is both an injection and surjection.
      This type of function is called a bijection.

    <title>The Importance of the Domain and Codomain</title>
    <p>
      The functions in the next two examples will illustrate why the domain and the codomain of a function are just as important as the rule defining the outputs of a function when we need to determine if the function is a surjection.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="E_domainandcodomain">
      <title>A Function that Is Neither an Injection nor a Surjection</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f\x \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}</m> be defined by <m>f( x ) = x^2  + 1</m>.
          Notice that
          <me>
            f( 2 ) = 5  \text{ and }  f( { - 2} ) = 5
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is enough to prove that the function <m>f</m> is not an injection since this shows that there exist two different inputs that produce the same output.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>f( x ) = x^2 + 1</m>,
          we know that <m>f( x ) \geq 1</m> for all <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m>.
          This implies that the function <m>f</m> is not a surjection.
          For example, <m>- 2</m> is in the codomain of <m>f</m> and
          <m>f( x ) \ne - 2</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="E_domainandcodomain2">
      <title>A Function that Is Not an Injection but Is a Surjection</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>T = \left\{ y \in \mathbb{R} \mid y \geq 1 \right\}</m>,
          and define <m>F\x \mathbb{R} \to T</m> by <m>F( x ) = x^2 + 1</m>.
          As in <xref ref="E_domainandcodomain">Example</xref>,
          the function <m>F</m> is not an injection since <m>F( 2 ) = F( { - 2} ) = 5</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is the function <m>F</m> a surjection?
          That is, does <m>F</m> map <m>\mathbb{R}</m> onto <m>T</m>?
          As in <xref ref="E_domainandcodomain">Example</xref>,
          we do know that <m>F( x ) \geq 1</m> for all <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see if it is a surjection,
          we must determine if it is true that for every <m>y \in T</m>,
          there exists an <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m> such that <m>F ( x ) = y</m>.
          So we choose <m>y \in T</m>.
          The goal is to determine if there exists an <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m> such that
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}F( x ) \amp = y \text{ , or }  \\ x^2  + 1 \amp = y. \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          One way to proceed is to work backward and solve the last equation
          (if possible)
          for <m>x</m>.
          Doing so, we get
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}x^2  \amp = y - 1 \\ x = \sqrt {y - 1} \amp \text{   or   } x =  - \sqrt {y - 1}. \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, since <m>y \in T</m>,
          we know that <m>y \geq 1</m> and hence that <m>y - 1 \geq 0</m>.
          This means that <m>\sqrt {y - 1}  \in \mathbb{R}</m>.
          Hence, if we use <m>x = \sqrt {y - 1}</m>,
          then <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m>, and
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}F( x ) \amp = F\left( {\sqrt {y - 1} } \:\right) \\ \amp = \left( {\sqrt {y - 1} } \: \right)^2  + 1 \\ \amp = ( {y - 1} ) + 1 \\ \amp = y. \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This proves that <m>F</m> is a surjection since we have shown that for all <m>y \in T</m>,
          there exists an <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m> such that <m>F( x ) = y</m>.
          Notice that for each <m>y \in T</m>,
          this was a constructive proof of the existence of an
          <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m> such that <m>F ( x ) = y</m>.

      <em>An Important Lesson</em>.
      In <xref ref="E_domainandcodomain">Examples</xref>
      and <xref ref="E_domainandcodomain2"></xref>,
      the same mathematical formula was used to determine the outputs for the functions.
      However, one function was not a surjection and the other one was a surjection.
      This illustrates the important fact that whether a function is surjective depends not only on the formula that defines the output of the function but also on the domain and codomain of the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next example will show that whether or not a function is an injection also depends on the domain of the function.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="E_domainandcodomain3">
      <title>A Function that Is an Injection but Is Not a Surjection</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\mathbb{Z}^* = \left\{ { {x \in \mathbb{Z}} \mid x \geq 0} \right\} = \mathbb{N} \cup \left\{ 0 \right\}</m>.

        <p>
          Notice that the codomain is <m>\mathbb{N}</m>,
          and the table of values suggests that some natural numbers are not outputs of this function.
          So it appears that the function <m>g</m> is not a surjection.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prove that <m>g</m> is not a surjection,
          pick an element of <m>\N</m> that does not appear to be in the range.
          We will use 3, and we will use a proof by contradiction to prove that there is no <m>x</m> in the domain
          <m>\left( \Z^*\right)</m> such that <m>g( x ) = 3</m>.
          So we assume that there exists an
          <m>x \in \Z^*</m> with <m>g( x ) = 3</m>.
          Then
          <md>
            <mrow>x^2  + 1 \amp = 3</mrow>
            <mrow>x^2 \amp = 2</mrow>
            <mrow>x \amp =  \pm \sqrt 2</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this is not possible since <m>\sqrt 2 \notin \mathbb{Z}^*</m>.
          Therefore, there is no <m>x \in \mathbb{Z}^*</m> with <m>g( x ) = 3</m>.
          This means that for every <m>x \in \mathbb{Z}^*</m>, <m>g( x ) \ne 3</m>.
          Therefore, 3 is not in the range of <m>g</m>,
          and hence <m>g</m> is not a surjection.
        </p>
        <p>
          The table of values suggests that different inputs produce different outputs,
          and hence that <m>g</m> is an injection.
          To prove that <m>g</m> is an injection,
          assume that <m>s, t \in \Z^*</m>
          (the domain)
          with <m>g( s ) = g( t )</m>.
          Then
          <md>
            <mrow>s^2  + 1 \amp = t^2  + 1</mrow>
            <mrow>s^2  \amp = t^2</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>s, t \in \mathbb{Z}^*</m>,
          we know that <m>s \geq 0\text{ and } t \geq 0</m>.
          So the preceding equation implies that <m>s = t</m>.
          Hence, <m>g</m> is an injection.
        </p>
      </statement>

      The functions in <xref ref="E_domainandcodomain">Examples</xref>

      are not injections but the function in <xref ref="E_domainandcodomain3">Example</xref> is an injection.
