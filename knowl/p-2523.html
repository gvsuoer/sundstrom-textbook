<p>Let  <span class="process-math">\(P( n )\)</span>  be, “The natural number  <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>  can be written as a sum of natural numbers, each of which is a 2  or a  3.” Verify that <span class="process-math">\(P( 4 ), P( 5 ), P( 6 )\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P( 7 )\)</span> are true. To use the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction, assume that <span class="process-math">\(k \in \mathbb{N}, k \geq 5\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(P( 4 ), P( 5 ),  \ldots , P( k )\)</span> are true.  Then notice that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
k + 1 = ( {k - 1} ) + 2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since  <span class="process-math">\(k - 1 \geq 4\text{,}\)</span> we have assumed that  <span class="process-math">\(P( {k - 1} )\)</span> is true. This means that <span class="process-math">\((k-1)\)</span> can be written as a sum of natural numbers, each of which is a 2 or a 3.  Since <span class="process-math">\(k + 1 = (k - 1) + 2\text{,}\)</span> we can conclude that <span class="process-math">\((k+1)\)</span> can be written as a sum of natural numbers, each of which is a 2 or a 3. This completes the proof of the inductive step.</p>
