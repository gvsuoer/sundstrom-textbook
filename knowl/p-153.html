<p>Although it is not a perfect analogy, think of the statement <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> as being <em class="emphasis">false</em> to mean that I lied and think of the statement <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> as being <em class="emphasis">true</em> to mean that I did not lie. We will now check the truth value of <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> based on the truth values of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span></p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Suppose that both <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> are true. That is, it is not raining and Daisy is riding her bike. In this case, it seems reasonable to say that I told the truth and that <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is false or that it is not raining and Daisy is not riding her bike. It would appear that by making the statement, “If it is not raining, then Daisy is riding her bike,” I have not told the truth. So in this case, the statement <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> is false.</p></li>
<li><p>Now suppose that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is false and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true or that it is raining and Daisy is riding her bike. Did I make a false statement by stating that if it is not raining, then Daisy is riding her bike? The key is that I did not make any statement about what would happen if it was raining, and so I did not tell a lie. So we consider the conditional statement, “If it is not raining, then Daisy is riding her bike,” to be true in the case where it is raining and Daisy is riding her bike.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, suppose that both <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> are false. That is, it is raining and Daisy is not riding her bike. As in the previous situation, since my statement was <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\text{,}\)</span> I made no claim about what would happen if it was raining, and so I did not tell a lie. So the statement <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> cannot be false in this case and so we consider it to be true.</p></li>
