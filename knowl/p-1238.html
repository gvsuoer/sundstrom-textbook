<p>If it is necessary to refer to an equation later in a proof, that equation should be centered and displayed. It should then be given a number. The number for the equation should be written in parentheses on the same line as the equation at the right-hand margin as in shown in the following example. <blockquote class="blockquote">Since <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an odd integer, there exists an integer <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> such that</blockquote></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/direct_eq1.html ./knowl/T_transdivide.html">
\begin{equation}
x = 2n + 1\text{.}\tag{3}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Later in the proof, there may be a line such as <blockquote class="blockquote">Then, using the result in equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/direct_eq1.html" title="Equation 3">(3)</a>, we obtain ….</blockquote> Notice that we did not number every equation in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_transdivide.html" title="Theorem 3.1">Theorem 3.1</a>. We should only number those equations we will be referring to later in the proof, and we should only number equations when it is necessary.  For example, instead of numbering an equation, it is often better to use a phrase such as, “the previous equation proves that …” or “we can rearrange the terms on the right side of the previous equation.” Also, note that the word “equation” is not capitalized when we are referring to an equation by number.  Although it may be appropriate to use a capital “E,” the usual convention in mathematics is not to capitalize.</p>
