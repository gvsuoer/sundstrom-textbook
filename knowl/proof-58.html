<p>The first part of this theorem was proved in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_primefactors.html" title="Theorem 4.11">Theorem 4.11</a>. We will prove the second part of the theorem by induction on <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> using the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction. (See <a href="S_otherinduction.html" class="internal" title="Section 4.2: Other Forms of Mathematical Induction">Section 4.2</a>.) For each natural number <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(n &gt; 1\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(P( n )\)</span> be <blockquote class="blockquote">If <span class="process-math">\(n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_s\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(p_1 , p_2 , \ldots, p_r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q_1 , q_2 , \ldots, q_s\)</span> are primes with <span class="process-math">\(p_1 \leq p_2 \leq \cdots \leq p_r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q_1 \leq q_2 \leq \cdots \leq q_s\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(r = s\text{,}\)</span> and for each <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> from 1 to <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(p_j = q_j\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote></p>
<p>For the basis step, we notice that since 2 is a prime number, its only factorization is <span class="process-math">\(2 = 1 \cdot 2\text{.}\)</span> This means that the only equation of the form <span class="process-math">\(2 = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(p_1 , p_2 , \ldots,
p_r\)</span> are prime numbers, is the case where <span class="process-math">\(r = 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(p_1 = 2\text{.}\)</span> This proves that <span class="process-math">\(P( 2 )\)</span> is true.</p>
<p>For the inductive step, let <span class="process-math">\(k \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(k \geq 2\text{.}\)</span> We will assume that <span class="process-math">\(P( 2 ), P( 3 ), \ldots , P( k )\)</span> are true. The goal now is to prove that <span class="process-math">\(P( {k + 1} )\)</span> is true. To prove this, we assume that <span class="process-math">\((k + 1)\)</span> has two prime factorizations and then prove that these prime factorizations are the same. So we assume that <blockquote class="blockquote">
<span class="process-math">\(k + 1 = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(k + 1 = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_s\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(p_1 , p_2 , \ldots, p_r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q_1 , q_2 , \ldots, q_s\)</span> are primes with <span class="process-math">\(p_1 \leq p_2 \leq \cdots \leq p_r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q_1 \leq q_2 \leq \cdots \leq q_s\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> We must now prove that <span class="process-math">\(r = s\text{,}\)</span> and for each <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> from 1 to <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(p_j = q_j\text{.}\)</span> We can break our proof into two cases: (1) <span class="process-math">\(p_1 \leq q_1\text{;}\)</span> and (2) <span class="process-math">\(q_1 \leq p_1\text{.}\)</span> Since one of these must be true, and since the proofs will be similar, we can assume, without loss of generality, that <span class="process-math">\(p_1 \leq q_1\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="process-math">\(k + 1 = p_1 p_2  \cdots p_r\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(p_1 \mid \left( {k + 1} \right)\text{,}\)</span> and hence we may conclude that <span class="process-math">\(p_1 \mid \left( {q_1 q_2  \cdots q_s } \right)\text{.}\)</span> We now use <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/C_primedivides.html" title="Corollary 8.16">Corollary 8.16</a> to conclude that there exists a <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(1 \leq j \leq s\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(p_1 \mid q_j\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(p_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q_j\)</span> are primes, we conclude that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/C_primedivides.html">
\begin{equation*}
p_1  = q_j\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We have also assumed that <span class="process-math">\(q_1  \leq q_j\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> and, hence, we know that <span class="process-math">\(q_1  \leq p_1\text{.}\)</span> However, we have also assumed that <span class="process-math">\(p_1  \leq q_1\text{.}\)</span> Hence,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
p_1  = q_1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We now use this and the fact that <span class="process-math">\(k + 1 = p_1 p_2  \cdots p_r  = q_1 q_2  \cdots q_s\)</span> to conclude that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
p_2  \cdots p_r  = q_2  \cdots q_s\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The product in the previous equation is less than <span class="process-math">\(k + 1\text{.}\)</span> Hence, we can apply our induction hypothesis to these factorizations and conclude that <span class="process-math">\(r = s\text{,}\)</span> and for each <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> from 2 to <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(p_j = q_j\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>This completes the proof that if <span class="process-math">\(P( 2 ), P( 3 ), \ldots , P( k )\)</span> are true, then <span class="process-math">\(P( {k + 1} )\)</span> is true. Hence, by the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(P( n )\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(n \geq 2\text{.}\)</span> This completes the proof of the theorem.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_primefactorizations.html#proof-58" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
