<p>When proving theorems in mathematics, it is often important to be able to decide if two expressions are logically equivalent. Sometimes when we are attempting to prove a theorem, we may be unsuccessful in developing a proof for the original statement of the theorem. However, in some cases, it is possible to prove an equivalent statement. Knowing that the statements are equivalent tells us that if we prove one, then we have also proven the other. In fact, once we know the truth value of a statement, then we know the truth value of any other logically equivalent statement.
