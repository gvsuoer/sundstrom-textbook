<p>If it is necessary to refer to an equation later in a proof, that equation should be centered and displayed, and it should be given a number. The number for the equation should be written in parentheses on the same line as the equation at the right-hand margin.</p>
<p>Example: Since  <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>  is an odd integer, there exists an integer  <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>  such that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation}
x = 2n + 1\text{.}\tag{83}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Later in the proof, there may be a line such as Then, using the result in equation (1), we obtain <span class="process-math">\(\ldots \text{.}\)</span> Please note that we should only number those equations we will be referring to later in the proof. Also, note that the word “equation” is not capitalized when we are referring to an equation by number. Although it may be appropriate to use a capital “E,” the usual convention in mathematics is not to capitalize.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="C_writingguides.html#li-808" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
