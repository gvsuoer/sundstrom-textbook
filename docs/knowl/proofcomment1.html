<p> When we constructed the know-show table prior to writing a proof for <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_xyodd.html" title="Theorem 1.10">Theorem 1.10</a>, we had only one answer for the backward question and one answer for the forward question. Often, there can be more than one answer for these questions. For example, consider the following statement: <blockquote class="blockquote">If \(x\) is an odd integer, then \(x^2\) is an odd integer.</blockquote> The backward question for this could be, “How do I prove that an integer is an odd integer?” One way to answer this is to use the definition of an odd integer, but another way is to use the result of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_xyodd.html" title="Theorem 1.10">Theorem 1.10</a>. That is, we can prove an integer is odd by proving that it is a product of two odd integers.</p>
<p>The difficulty then is deciding which answer to use. Sometimes we can tell by carefully watching the interplay between the forward process and the backward process. Other times, we may have to work with more than one possible answer.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1direct.html#proofcomment1">in-context</a></span>
