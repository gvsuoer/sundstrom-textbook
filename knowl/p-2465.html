<p>This work is intended to show the need for another principle of induction. In the inductive step of a proof by induction, we assume one statement is true and prove the next one is true. The idea of this new principle is to assume that <em class="emphasis">all</em> of the previous statements are true and use this assumption to prove the next statement is true. This is stated formally in terms of subsets of natural numbers in the <dfn class="terminology">Second Principle of Mathematical Induction</dfn>. Rather than stating this principle in two versions, we will state the extended version of the Second Principle. In many cases, we will use <span class="process-math">\(M = 1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(M = 0\text{.}\)</span></p>
