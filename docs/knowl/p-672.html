<p>The logical equivalency <span class="process-math">\(\mynot \left( {P \to Q} \right) \equiv P \wedge \mynot Q\)</span> is interesting because it shows us that <em class="emphasis">the negation of a conditional statement is not another conditional statement.</em> The negation of a conditional statement can be written in the form of a conjunction. So what does it mean to say that the conditional statement <blockquote class="blockquote">If you do not clean your room, then you cannot watch TV,</blockquote> is false? To answer this, we can use the logical equivalency <span class="process-math">\(\mynot \left( {P \to Q} \right) \equiv P \wedge \mynot Q\text{.}\)</span> The idea is that if <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> is false, then its negation must be true. So the negation of this can be written as <blockquote class="blockquote">You do not clean your room and you can watch TV.</blockquote> For another example, consider the following conditional statement:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\text{If } -5 \lt -3, \text{then } \left( -5 \right)^2 \lt \left( -3 \right)^2.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">This conditional statement is false since its hypothesis is true and its conclusion is false. Consequently, its negation must be true. Its negation is not a conditional statement. The negation can be written in the form of a conjunction by using the logical equivalency <span class="process-math">\(\mynot \left( {P \to Q} \right) \equiv P \wedge \mynot Q\text{.}\)</span> So, the negation can be written as follows:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
-5 \lt -3 \text{ and } \mynot \left( {\left( -5 \right)^2 \lt \left( -3 \right)^2} \right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">However, the second part of this conjunction can be written in a simpler manner by noting that “not less than” means the same thing as “greater than or equal to.” So we use this to write the negation of the original conditional statement as follows:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
-5 \lt -3 \text{ and } \left( -5 \right)^2 \geqslant \left( -3 \right)^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">This conjunction is true since each of the individual statements in the conjunction is true.</p>
