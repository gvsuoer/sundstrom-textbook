      <title><em>Compound Statements</em></title>
      <p>
        Mathematicians often develop ways to construct new mathematical objects from existing mathematical objects.
        It is possible to form new statements from existing statements by connecting the statements with words such as
        <q>and</q>
        and
        <q>or</q>
        or by negating the statement.

        (or <term>connective</term>)
            <idx><h>connective</h></idx>
        on mathematical statements is a word or combination of words that combines one or more mathematical statements to make a new mathematical statement.

            <idx><h>compound statement</h></idx>
            <idx><h>statement</h><h>compound</h></idx>
        is a statement that contains one or more operators.
        Because some operators are used so frequently in logic and mathematics,
        we give them names and use special symbols to represent them.

              and is denoted by <m>P \to Q</m> . The statement <m>P \to Q</m> is often read as
              <q><m>P</m> <em>implies</em> <m>Q</m>,</q>
              and we have seen in <xref ref="S_prop">Section</xref>
              that <m>P \to Q</m> is false only when <m>P</m> is true and <m>Q</m> is false.

        <term>Some comments about the disjunction</term>.
        It is important to understand the use of the operator
        <q>or.</q>
        In mathematics, we use the <term>
        <q>inclusive or</q>
        </term>
            <idx><h>inclusive or</h></idx>
        unless stated otherwise.
        This means that <m>P \vee Q</m> is true when both <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are true and also when only one of them is true.
        That is, <m>P \vee Q</m> is true when at least one of <m>P</m> or <m>Q</m> is true,
        or <m>P \vee Q</m> is false only when both <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are false.
      </p>
      <p>
        A different use of the word
        <q>or</q>
        is the <term>
        <q>exclusive or.</q>
        </term>
            <idx><h>exclusive or</h></idx>
        For the exclusive or,
        the resulting statement is false when both statements are true.
        That is,
        <q><m>P</m> exclusive or <m>Q</m></q>
        is true only when exactly one of <m>P</m> or <m>Q</m> is true.
        In everyday life, we often use the exclusive or.
        When someone says,
        <q>At the intersection, turn left or go straight,</q>
        this person is using the exclusive or.

        <term>Some comments about the negation</term>.
        Although the statement, <m>\mynot P</m>, can be read as
        <q>It is not the case that <m>P</m>,</q>
        there are often better ways to say or write this in English.
        For example, we would usually say (or write):
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The negation of the statement,
              <q>391 is prime</q>
              is
              <q>391 is not prime.</q>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The negation of the statement,
              <q><m>12 \lt 9</m></q>
              is
              <q><m>12 \geq 9</m>.</q>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            For the statements <m>P</m>: 15 is odd <m>Q</m>: 15 is prime write each of the following statements as English sentences and determine whether they are true or false.
            Notice that <m>P</m> is true and <m>Q</m> is false.

        We will use the following two statements for all of this activity:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>P</m> is the statement
              <q>It is raining.</q>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>Q</m> is the statement
              <q>Daisy is playing golf.</q>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        In each of the following four parts,
        a truth value will be assigned to statements <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>.
        For example, in Question<nbsp/>(1),
        we will assume that each statement is true.
        In Question<nbsp/>(2), we will assume that <m>P</m> is true and <m>Q</m> is false.
        In each part,
        determine the truth value of each of the following statements:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              \makebox[1.2in][l]{(<m>P \wedge Q</m>)} It is raining and Daisy is playing golf.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              \makebox[1.2in][l]{(<m>P \vee Q</m>)} It is raining or Daisy is playing golf.

          <li>
            <p>
              \makebox[1.2in][l]{(<m>P \to Q</m>)} If it is raining,
              then Daisy is playing golf.

        Which of the four statements [(a) through (d)] are true and which are false in each of the following four situations?

      Conditional statements
          <idx><h>conditional statement</h></idx>
          <idx><h>conditional statement</h><h>forms of</h></idx>
      are extremely important in mathematics because almost all mathematical theorems are
      (or can be)
      stated as a conditional statement in the following form: If
      <q>certain conditions are met,</q>
      then
      <q>something happens.</q>
      It is imperative that all students studying mathematics thoroughly understand the meaning of a conditional statement and the truth table for a conditional statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also need to be aware that in the English language,
      there are other ways for expressing the conditional statement <m>P \to Q</m> other than
      <q>If <m>P</m>, then <m>Q</m>.</q>
      Following are some common ways to express the conditional statement <m>P \to Q</m> in the English language:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>P</m>, then <m>Q</m>.

    <title>Constructing Truth Tables</title>
    <p>
      Truth tables for compound statements can be constructed by using the truth tables for the basic connectives.
      To illustrate this,
      we will construct a truth table for <m>\left( {P \wedge \mynot Q} \right) \to R</m>.
      The first step is to determine the number of rows needed.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            For a truth table with two different simple statements,
            four rows are needed since there are four different combinations of truth values for the two statements.
            We should be consistent with how we set up the rows.
            The way we will do it in this text is to label the rows for the first statement with (T, T, F, F) and the rows for the second statement with (T, F, T, F).
            All truth tables in the text have this scheme.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            For a truth table with three different simple statements,
            eight rows are needed since there are eight different combinations of truth values for the three statements.
            Our standard scheme for this type of truth table is shown in <xref ref="Ta_compoundtruthtable">Table</xref>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The next step is to determine the columns to be used.
      One way to do this is to work backward from the form of the given statement.
      For <m>\left( {P \wedge \mynot Q} \right) \to R</m>,
      the last step is to deal with the conditional operator <m>\left( \to \right)</m>.
      To do this, we need to know the truth values of <m>\left( {P \wedge \mynot Q} \right)</m> and <m>R</m>.
      To determine the truth values for <m>\left( {P \wedge \mynot Q} \right)</m>,
      we need to apply the rules for the conjunction operator
      <m>\left( \wedge \right)</m> and we need to know the truth values for <m>P</m> and <m>\mynot Q</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="Ta_compoundtruthtable">Table</xref>
      is a completed truth table for
      <m>\left( {P \wedge \mynot Q} \right) \to R</m> with the step numbers indicated at the bottom of each column.
      The step numbers correspond to the order in which the columns were completed.

      The word

          that <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> are false statements,
          and that <m>W</m> is a statement and it is not known if <m>W</m> is true or false.
          Which of the following statements are true, which are false,
          and for which statements is it not possible to determine if it is true or false?
          Justify your conclusions.
