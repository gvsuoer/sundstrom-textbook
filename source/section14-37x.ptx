          We first prove that <m>f\x A \to B</m> is an injection.
          So let <m>x, y \in A</m> and assume that <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>.
          Then <m>x + 350 = y + 350</m> and we can conclude that <m>x = y</m>.
          Hence, <m>f</m> is an injection.
          To prove that <m>f</m> is a surjection, let <m>b \in B</m>.
          Then <m>351 \leq b \leq 450</m> and hence,
          <m>1 \leq b - 350 \leq 100</m> and so <m>b - 350 \in A</m>.
          In addition, <m>f(b - 350) = (b - 350) + 350 = b</m>.
          This proves that <m>f</m> is a surjection.
          Hence, the function <m>f</m> is a bijection,
          and so, <m>A \approx B</m>.

      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>x</m> and <m>t</m> are even integers and <m>F ( x ) = F ( t )</m>,
          then <m>x + 1 = t + 1</m> and, hence, <m>x = t</m>.
          Therefore, <m>F</m> is an injection.
          To prove that <m>F</m> is a surjection, let <m>y \in D</m>.
          This means that <m>y</m> is an odd integer and, hence,
          <m>y - 1</m> is an even integer.
          In addition,
          <me>
            F ( y - 1 ) = ( y - 1 ) + 1 = y
          </me>.
          Therefore, <m>F</m> is a surjection and hence, <m>F</m> is a bijection.
          We conclude that <m>E \approx D</m>.
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          Let <m>x, t \in ( 0, 1 )</m> and assume that <m>f ( x ) = f ( t )</m>.
          Then <m>bx = bt</m> and, hence, <m>x = t</m>.
          Therefore, <m>f</m> is an injection.
          To prove that <m>f</m> is a surjection,
          let <m>y \in ( 0, b )</m>.
          Since <m>0 \lt  y \lt  b</m>,
          we conclude that <m>0 \lt  \dfrac{y}{b} \lt  1</m> and that
          <me>
            f \!\left( \dfrac{y}{b} \right) = b \!\left( \dfrac{y}{b} \right) = y
          </me>.
          Therefore, <m>f</m> is a surjection and hence <m>f</m> is a bijection.
          Thus, <m>( 0, 1 ) \approx ( 0, b )</m>.
