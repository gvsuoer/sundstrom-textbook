<p>The first step is to identify the hypothesis, <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> and the conclusion, <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> of the conditional statement. In this case, we have the following: <blockquote class="blockquote">
<span class="process-math">\(P\text{:}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are odd integers.</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">
<span class="process-math">\(Q\text{:}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x \cdot y\)</span> is an odd integer.</blockquote> We now treat <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> as what we know (we have assumed it to be true) and treat <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> as what we want to show (that is, the goal). So we organize this by using <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> as the first step in the know portion of the table and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> as the last step in the show portion of the table. We will put the know portion of the table at the top and the show portion of the table at the bottom.</p>
