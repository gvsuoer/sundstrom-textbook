            Let <m>a = 27</m> and <m>b = 4</m>.
            We will now determine several pairs of integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> so that <m>27 = 4q + r</m>.

        Division is not considered an operation on the set of integers since the quotient of two integers need not be an integer.
        However, we have all divided one integer by another and obtained a quotient and a remainder.
        For example,
        if we divide 113 by 5, we obtain a quotient of 22 and a remainder of 3.
        We can write this as <m>\dfrac{113}{5} = 22 + \dfrac{3}{5}</m>.
        If we multiply both sides of this equation by 5 and then use the distributive property to
        <q>clear the parentheses,</q>
        we obtain
        <md>
          <mrow>5 \cdot \frac{113}{5} \amp = 5 \left( 22 + \frac{3}{5} \right)</mrow>
          <mrow>113   \amp = 5 \cdot 22 + 3</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the equation that we use when working in the integers since it involves only multiplication and addition of integers.

        <me>
          A = \left\{ a \in \Z \mid \mod{a}{3}{6} \right\} = \{ \ldots, -15, -9, -3, 3, 9, 15, 21, \ldots \}

          <idx><h>Division Algorithm|(</h></idx>
      Beginning  <xref ref="PA_quotients"></xref>
      was an introduction to a mathematical result known as the Division Algorithm.
      One of the purposes of this beginning  activity was to illustrate that we have already worked with this result,
      perhaps without knowing its name.
      For example, when we divide 337 by 6, we often write
      <me>
        \frac{{337}}{6} = 56 + \frac{1}{6}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we multiply both sides of this equation by 6, we get
      <me>
        337 = 6 \cdot 56 + 1
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we are working within the system of integers,
      the second equation is preferred over the first since the second one uses only integers and the operations of addition and multiplication,
      and the integers are closed under addition and multiplication.
      Following is a complete statement of the Division Algorithm.
    </p>
    <em>The Division Algorithm</em>
    For all integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> with <m>b>0</m>,  there exist unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that
    <me>
      a=bq+r  \text{ and }   0 \leq r \lt  b
    </me>.
    <p>
      <em>Some Comments about the Division Algorithm</em>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The Division Algorithm can be proven,
            but we have not yet studied the methods that are usually used to do so.
            In this text,
            we will treat the Division Algorithm as an axiom of the integers.
            The work in <xref ref="PA_quotients"></xref>
            provides some rationale that this is a reasonable axiom.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The statement of the Division Algorithm contains the new phrase,
            <q>there exist unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that <m>\ldots </m>.</q>
            This means that there is only one pair of integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> that satisfy both the conditions
            <m>a = bq + r</m> and <m>0 \leq r \lt b</m>.
            As we saw in <xref ref="PA_quotients"></xref>,
            there are several different ways to write the integer <m>a</m> in the form <m>a = bq + r</m>.
            However, there is only one way to do this and satisfy the additional condition that <m>0 \leq r \lt b</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In light of the previous comment,
            when we speak of <em>the quotient</em>
              <idx><h>quotient</h></idx>
            and <em>the remainder</em>
              <idx><h>remainder</h></idx>
            when we
            <q>divide an integer <m>a</m> by the positive integer <m>b</m>,</q>
            we will always mean the quotient <m>\left( q \right)</m> and the remainder
            <m>\left( r \right)</m> guaranteed by the Division Algorithm.
            So the remainder <m>r</m> is the least nonnegative integer such that there exists an integer (quotient) <m>q</m> with <m>a = bq + r</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If  <m>a \lt  0</m>,
            then we must be careful when writing the result of the Division Algorithm.
            For example,
            in parts<nbsp/><xref ref="PA_quotients4"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="PA_quotients5"/> of Beginning  <xref ref="PA_quotients"></xref>,
            with <m>a =  - 17</m>  and <m>b = 5</m>,
            we obtained <m>-17 = 5\cdot(-4) + 3</m>,
            and so the quotient is <m>-4</m> and the remainder is 3.
            Notice that this is different than the result from a calculator,
            which would be <m>\dfrac{{ - 17}}{5} =  - 3.4</m>.
            But this means
            <me>
              \frac{{ - 17}}{5} =  - \left( {3 + \frac{4}{{10}}} \right) =  - 3 - \frac{2}{5}
            </me>.
            If we multiply both sides of this equation by 5, we obtain
            <me>
              {-17} = 5\left( { - 3} \right) + \left( { - 2} \right)
            </me>.
            This is not the result guaranteed by the Division Algorithm since the value of <m>-2</m> does not satisfy the result of being greater than or equal to 0 and less than 5.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            One way to look at the Division Algorithm is that the integer  <m>a</m>  is either going to be a multiple of  <m>b</m>,
            or it will lie between two multiples of  <m>b</m>.
            Suppose that  <m>a</m>  is not a multiple of  <m>b</m> and that it lies between the multiples
            <m>b \cdot q</m>  and  <m>b\left( {q + 1} \right)</m>,
            where <m>q</m> is some integer.
            This is shown on the number line in <xref ref="fig_divalgo">Figure</xref>.
            <figure xml:id="fig_divalgo">
              <caption>Remainder for the Division Algorithm</caption>
              <image width="73%" source="images/figps-divalgo.png"/>
            </figure>
            If  <m>r</m>  represents the distance from  <m>b \cdot q</m> to  <m>a</m>, then
            <me>
              \begin{aligned}r \amp = a - b \cdot q,\text{ or }  \\ a \amp = b \cdot q + r. \end{aligned}
            </me>
            From the diagram,
            also notice that  <m>r</m>  is less than the distance between
            <m>b \cdot q</m> and  <m>b\left( {q + 1} \right)</m>.
            Algebraically, this distance is
            <me>
              \begin{aligned}b\left( {q + 1} \right) - b \cdot q \amp = b \cdot q + b - b \cdot q \\ \amp = b. \end{aligned}
            </me>
            Thus, in the case where  <m>a</m>  is not a multiple of  <m>b</m>,
            we get  <m>0 \lt  r \lt  b</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We have been implicitly using the fact that an integer cannot be both even and odd.
            There are several ways to understand this fact,
            but one way is through the Division Algorithm.
            When we classify an integer as even or odd,
            we are doing so on the basis of the remainder
            (according to the Division Algorithm)
            when the integer is
            <q>divided</q>
            by 2.
            If  <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
            then by the Division Algorithm there exist unique integers  <m>q</m>  and  <m>r</m>  such that

              a = 2q + r\text{  and  } 0 \leq r \lt  2
            </me>.
            This means that the remainder,
            <m>r</m>,  can only be zero or one
            (and not both).
            When  <m>r = 0</m>, the integer is even,
            and when  <m>r = 1</m>, the integer is odd.

    <title>Using Cases Determined by the Division Algorithm</title>
    <p>
      The Division Algorithm <idx><h>Division Algorithm</h><h>using cases|(</h></idx> can sometimes be used to construct cases that can be used to prove a statement that is true for all integers.
      We have done this when we divided the integers into the even integers and the odd integers since even integers have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2 and odd integers have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes it is more useful to divide the integer <m>a</m> by an integer other than 2.
      For example,
      if <m>a</m> is divided by 3, there are three possible remainders: 0, 1, and 2.
      If <m>a</m> is divided by 4, there are four possible remainders: 0, 1, 2, and 3.
      The remainders form the basis for the cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the hypothesis of a proposition is that
      <q><m>n</m> is an integer,</q>
      then we can use the Division Algorithm to claim that there are unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that
      <me>
        n = 3q + r\text{  and  } 0 \leq r \lt  3
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can then divide the proof into the following three cases: (1) <m>r = 0</m>; (2) <m>r = 1</m>;
      and (3) <m>r = 2</m>.
      This is done in <xref ref="P_3divides">Proposition</xref>.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="P_3divides">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>n</m> is an integer, then 3 divides <m>n^3-n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>n</m> be an integer.
        We will show that 3 divides <m>n^3-n</m> by examining the three cases for the remainder when <m>n</m> is divided by 3.
        By the Division Algorithm,
        there exist unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that
        <me>
          n = 3q + r\text{ , and  } 0 \leq r \lt  3
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that we can consider the following three cases: (1) <m>r = 0</m>; (2) <m>r = 1</m>;
        and (3) <m>r = 2</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case where <m>r = 0</m>, we have <m>n = 3q</m>.
        By substituting this into the expression <m>n^3  - n</m>, we get
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}n^3  - n \amp = \left( {3q} \right)^3  - \left( {3q} \right) \\ \amp = 27q^3  - 3q \\ \amp = 3\left( {9q^3  - q} \right). \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>\left( {9q^3 -q} \right)</m> is an integer,
        the last equation proves that <m>3 \mid \left( n^3 - n \right)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the second case, <m>r = 1</m> and <m>n = 3q + 1</m>.
        When we substitute this into <m>\left( n^3 - n \right)</m>,
        we obtain
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}n^3  - n \amp = \left( {3q + 1} \right)^3  - \left( {3q + 1} \right) \\ \amp = \left( 27q^3 + 27q^2 +9q + 1\right) - \left( 3q + 1 \right) \\ \amp = 27q^3 + 27q^2 + 6q \\ \amp = 3 \left( 9q^3 + 9q^2 + 2q \right). \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>\left( {9q^3 +9q^2 + 2q} \right)</m> is an integer,
        the last equation proves that <m>3 \mid \left( n^3 - n \right)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last case is when <m>r = 2</m>.
        The details for this case are part of Exercise<nbsp/><xref ref="exer_prop3divides"/>.
        Once this case is completed,
        we will have proved that 3 divides <m>n^3 - n</m> in all three cases.
        Hence, we may conclude that if <m>n</m> is an integer,
        then 3 divides <m>n^3 - n</m>.

    <title>Properties of Congruence</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>congruence|(</h></idx>
      Most of the work we have done so far has involved using definitions to help prove results.
      We will continue to prove some results but we will now prove some theorems about congruence
      (<xref ref="T_propsofcong">Theorem</xref>
      and <xref ref="T_modprops">Theorem</xref>)
      that we will then use to help prove other results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
      Recall that if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are integers,
      then we say that <m>a</m> is congruent to <m>b</m> modulo <m>n</m> provided that <m>n</m> divides <m>a - b</m>,
      and we write <m>a \equiv b \pmod n</m>.
      (See <xref ref="S_directproof"></xref>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We are now going to prove some properties of congruence that are direct consequences of the definition.
      One of these properties was suggested by the work in <xref ref="PA_congruencereview"></xref>
      and is Part<nbsp/><xref ref="T_propsofcong1"/> of the next theorem.

            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will prove Parts<nbsp/><xref ref="T_propsofcong2"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="T_propsofcong3"/>.
        The proof of Part<nbsp/><xref ref="T_propsofcong1"/> is <xref ref="pr_propsofcong"></xref>.
        Let <m>n</m> be a natural number and let <m>a,
        b, c, \text{ and }   d</m> be integers.
        Assume that <m>a \equiv b \pmod n</m> and that <m>c \equiv d \pmod n</m>.
        This means that <m>n</m> divides <m>a-b</m> and that <m>n</m> divides <m>c-d</m>.
        Hence, there exist integers <m>k</m> and <m>q</m> such that <m>a-b=nk</m> and <m>c-d=nq</m>.
        We can then write <m>a = b + nk</m> and <m>c = d + nq</m> and obtain
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}ac \amp = \left( {b + nk} \right)\left( {d + nq} \right) \\ \amp = bd + bnq + dnk + n^2 kq \\ \amp = bd + n\left( {bq + dk + nkq} \right). \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        By subtracting <m>bd</m> from both sides of the last equation,
        we see that
        <me>
          ac - bd = n\left( {bq + dk + nkq} \right)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>bq + dk + nkq</m> is an integer,
        this proves that <m>n \mid \left( {ac - bd} \right)</m>,
        and hence we can conclude that <m>ac \equiv bd \pmod n</m>.
        This completes the proof of Part<nbsp/><xref ref="T_propsofcong2"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Part<nbsp/>(2) basically means that if we have two congruences,
        we can multiply the corresponding sides of these congruences to obtain another congruence.
        We have assumed that <m>\mod{a}{b}{n}</m> and so we write this twice as follows:
        <md>
          <mrow>a \amp \equiv b \pmod n,  \text{ and }</mrow>
          <mrow>a \amp \equiv b \pmod n</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we now use the result in Part<nbsp/>(2) and multiply the corresponding sides of these two congruences,
        we obtain <m>\mod{a^2}{b^2}{n}</m>.
        We can then use this congruence and the congruence
        <m>a \equiv b \pmod n</m> and the result in Part<nbsp/>(2) to conclude that
        <me>
          a^2 \cdot a \equiv b^2 \cdot b \pmod n
        </me>,
        or that <m>a^3 \equiv b^3 \pmod n</m>.
        We can say that we can continue with this process to prove Part<nbsp/><xref ref="T_propsofcong3"/>,
        but this is not considered to be a formal proof of this result.
        To construct a formal proof for this,
        we could use a proof by mathematical induction.
        This will be studied in <xref ref="C_induction"></xref>.

          </ol>

      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will prove the reflexive property and the transitive property.
        The proof of the symmetric property is Exercise<nbsp/><xref ref="exer_cong-symm"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>, and let <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
        We will show that <m>a \equiv a \pmod n</m>.
        Notice that
        <me>
          a - a = 0 = n \cdot 0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This proves that <m>n</m> divides <m>\left( {a - a} \right)</m> and hence,
        by the definition of congruence modulo <m>n</m>,
        we have proven that <m>a \equiv a \pmod n</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove the transitive property,
        we let <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
        and let <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> be integers.
        We assume that <m>a \equiv b \pmod n</m> and that <m>b \equiv c \pmod n</m>.
        We will use the definition of congruence modulo <m>n</m> to prove that <m>a \equiv c \pmod n</m>.
        Since <m>a \equiv b \pmod n</m> and <m>b \equiv c \pmod n</m>,
        we know that <m>n \mid \left( a-b \right)</m> and <m>n \mid \left( b-c \right)</m>.
        Hence, there exist integers <m>k</m> and <m>q</m> such that
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}a-b \amp = nk \\ b-c \amp = nq. \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        By adding the corresponding sides of these two equations,
        we obtain
        <me>
          \left( {a - b} \right) + \left( {b - c} \right) = nk + nq
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we simplify the left side of the last equation and factor the right side, we get
        <me>
          a - c = n\left( {k + q} \right)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the closure property of the integers,
        <m>\left( {k + q} \right) \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
        and so this equation proves that
        <m>n \mid \left(a-c \right)</m> and hence that <m>a \equiv c \pmod n</m>.
        This completes the proof of the transitive property of congruence modulo <m>n</m>.

      Notice that the set of all integers that are congruent to 2 modulo 7 is
      <me>
        \left\{  n \in \Z \mid n \equiv 2 \pmod7 \right\} = \left\{ \ldots , - 19, - 12, - 5, 2, 9, 16, 23, \ldots \right\}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we divide any integer in this set by 7 and write the result according to the Division Algorithm,
      we will get a remainder of 2.
      For example,
      <md>
        <mrow>2 \amp = 7 \cdot 0 + 2 \amp   -5 \amp = 7 \left( -1 \right) + 2</mrow>
        <mrow>9 \amp = 7 \cdot 1 + 2 \amp   -12 \amp = 7 \left( -2 \right) +2</mrow>
        <mrow>16 \amp = 7 \cdot 2 + 2 \amp   -19 \amp = 7 \left( -3 \right) +2</mrow>
        <mrow>23 \amp = 7 \cdot 3 + 2. \amp    \amp</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Is this a coincidence or is this always true?
      Let's look at the general case.
      For this, let <m>n</m> be a natural number and let <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
      By the Division Algorithm,
      there exist unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that
      <me>
        a = nq + r\text{  and  } 0 \leq r \lt  n
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By subtracting <m>r</m> from both sides of the equation <m>a = nq + r</m>,
      we obtain
      <me>
        a - r = nq
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this implies that <m>n \mid \left( a - r \right)</m> and hence that <m>a \equiv r \pmod n</m>.
      We have proven the following result.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_congtorem">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m> and let <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
          If <m>a = nq + r\text{ and } 0 \leq r \lt n</m> for some integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>,
          then <m>a \equiv r \pmod n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This theorem says that an integer is congruent
      (mod <m>n</m>)
      to its remainder when it is divided by <m>n</m>.
      Since this remainder is unique and since the only possible remainders for division by <m>n</m> are <m>0,1,2, \ldots ,n - 1</m>,
      we can state the following result.
    </p>
    <corollary xml:id="C_congtorem">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>, then each integer is congruent,
          modulo <m>n</m>,
          to precisely one of the integers <m>0,1,2, \ldots ,n - 1</m>.
          That is, for each integer <m>a</m>,
          there exists a unique integer <m>r</m> such that
          <me>
            a \equiv r \pmod n  \text{ and }   0 \leq r \lt  n

    <p>
      <xref ref="C_congtorem">Corollary</xref>
      can be used to set up cases for an integer in a proof.
      If <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m> and <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
      then we can consider <m>n</m> cases for <m>a</m>.
      The integer <m>a</m> could be congruent to <m>0,1,2, \ldots , \text{ or }  n - 1</m> modulo <m>n</m>.
      For example,
      if we assume that 5 does not divide an integer <m>a</m>,
      then we know <m>a</m> is not congruent to 0 modulo 5, and hence,
      that <m>a</m> must be congruent to 1, 2, 3, or 4 modulo 5.
      We can use these as 4 cases within a proof.
      For example,
      suppose we wish to determine the values of <m>a^2</m> modulo 5 for integers that are not congruent to 0 modulo 5.
      We begin by squaring some integers that are not congruent to 0 modulo 5.
      We see that

      These explorations indicate that the following proposition is true and we will now outline a method to prove it.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop_congmod5">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For each integer <m>a</m>, if <m>a \not \equiv 0 \pmod 5</m>,
          then <m>\mod{a^2}{1}{5}</m> or <m>\mod{a^2}{4}{5}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      <em><em>Proof</em></em>.
      We will prove this proposition using cases for <m>a</m> based on congruence modulo 5.
      In doing so,
      we will use the results in <xref ref="T_propsofcong">Theorem</xref>
      and <xref ref="T_modprops">Theorem</xref>.
      Because the hypothesis is <m>a \not \equiv 0 \pmod 5</m>,
      we can use four cases,
      which are: (1) <m>\mod{a}{1}{5}</m>, (2)
      <m>\mod{a}{2}{5}</m>, (3) <m>\mod{a}{3}{5}</m>,
      and (4) <m>\mod{a}{4}{5}</m>.
      Following are proofs for the first and fourth cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Case 1</em>.
      <m>\left( \mod{a}{1}{5} \right)</m>.
      In this case,
      we use <xref ref="T_propsofcong">Theorem</xref> to conclude that
      <me>
        \mod{a^2}{1^2}{5}  \text{ or }   \mod{a^2}{1}{5}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proves that if <m>\mod{a}{1}{5}</m>,
      then <m>\mod{a^2}{1}{5}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Case 4</em>.
      <m>\left( \mod{a}{4}{5} \right)</m>.
      In this case,
      we use <xref ref="T_propsofcong">Theorem</xref> to conclude that
      <me>
        \mod{a^2}{4^2}{5}  \text{ or }   \mod{a^2}{16}{5}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also know that <m>\mod{16}{1}{5}</m>.
      So we have <m>\mod{a^2}{16}{5}</m> and <m>\mod{16}{1}{5}</m>,
      and we can now use the transitive property of congruence
      (<xref ref="T_modprops">Theorem</xref>)
      to conclude that <m>\mod{a^2}{1}{5}</m>.
      This proves that if <m>\mod{a}{4}{5}</m>,
      then <m>\mod{a^2}{1}{5}</m>.

      In the proof of <xref ref="prop_congmod5">Proposition</xref>,
      we used four cases.
      Sometimes it may seem a bit overwhelming when confronted with a proof that requires several cases.
      For example,
      if we want to prove something about some integers modulo 6, we may have to use six cases.
      However, there are sometimes additional assumptions
      (or conclusions)
      that can help reduce the number of cases that must be considered.
      This will be illustrated in the next progress check.

    <investigation xml:id="prog_casesmod6">
      <title>Using Cases Modulo 6</title>
      <p>
        Suppose we want to determine the possible values for <m>a^2</m> modulo 6 for odd integers that are not multiples of 3.
        Before beginning to use congruence arithmetic
        (as in the proof of <xref ref="prop_congmod5">Proposition</xref>)
        in each of the possible six cases,
        we can show that some of the cases are not possible under these assumptions.
        (In some sense,
        we use a short proof by contradiction for these cases.)
        So assume that <m>a</m> is an odd integer.
        Then:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>\mod{a}{0}{6}</m>,

              But then <m>a = 2(3k)</m> and hence, <m>a</m> is even.
              Since we assumed that <m>a</m> is odd,
              this case is not possible.

            <p>
              If <m>\mod{a}{2}{6}</m>,
              then there exists an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>a = 6k + 2</m>.
              But then <m>a = 2(3k + 1)</m> and hence, <m>a</m> is even.
              Since we assumed that <m>a</m> is odd,
              this case is not possible.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Prove that if <m>a</m> is an odd integer,
              then <m>a</m> cannot be congruent to 4 modulo 6.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Prove that if <m>a</m> is an integer and 3 does not divide <m>a</m>,

                if <m>(a + 2b) \equiv 0 \pmod 3</m>,
                then <m>(2a + b) \equiv 0 \pmod 3</m>.
                <proof>
                  <p>
                    We assume <m>a, b \in \Z</m> and <m>(a + 2b) \equiv 0 \pmod 3</m>.
                    This means that 3 divides <m>a + 2b</m> and, hence,
                    there exists an integer <m>m</m> such that <m>a + 2b = 3m</m>.
                    Hence, <m>a = 3m - 2b</m>.
                    For <m>(2a + b) \equiv 0 \pmod 3</m>,
                    there exists an integer <m>x</m> such that <m>2a + b = 3x</m>.
                    Hence,
                    <md>
                      <mrow>2(3m - 2b) + b \amp = 3x</mrow>
                      <mrow>6m - 3b \amp = 3x</mrow>
                      <mrow>3(2m - b) \amp = 3x</mrow>

                  <p>
                    Since <m>(2m - b)</m> is an integer,
                    this proves that 3 divides <m>(2a + b)</m> and hence,
                    <m>(2a + b) \equiv 0 \pmod 3</m>.

                    Let <m>m \in \Z</m>.
                    We will prove that 5 divides
                    <m>\left(m^5 - m \right)</m> by proving that <m>\left(m^5 - m \right) \equiv 0 \pmod 5</m>.
                    We will use cases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the first case, if <m>m \equiv 0 \pmod 5</m>,
                    then <m>m^5 \equiv 0 \pmod 5</m> and,
                    hence, <m>\left(m^5 - m \right) \equiv 0 \pmod 5</m>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the second case, if <m>m \equiv 1 \pmod 5</m>,
                    then <m>m^5 \equiv 1 \pmod 5</m> and, hence,
                    <m>\left(m^5 - m \right) \equiv (1 - 1) \pmod 5</m>,
                    which means that <m>\left(m^5 - m \right) \equiv 0 \pmod 5</m>.

                  <p>
                    For the third case, if <m>m \equiv 2 \pmod 5</m>,
                    then <m>m^5 \equiv 32 \pmod 5</m> and, hence,
                    <m>\left(m^5 - m \right) \equiv (32 - 2) \pmod 5</m>,
                    which means that <m>\left(m^5 - m \right) \equiv 0 \pmod 5</m>.

        The proof of the following proposition based on Part<nbsp/>(b) uses cases.  In this proof, however, we use cases and a proof by contradiction to prove that a certain integer cannot be odd.  Hence, it must be even.  Complete the proof of the proposition.  <em>Proposition.</em> Let  <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.  If  2  divides  <m>a</m>  and  3  divides  <m>a</m>, then  6  divides  <m>a</m>.   <em><em>Proof</em></em>:  Let  <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m> and assume that  2  divides  <m>a</m>  and  3  divides  <m>a</m>.  We will prove that  6 divides  <m>a</m>.  Since  3  divides  <m>a</m>, there exists an integer  <m>n</m>  such that
        <me>
          a = 3n
        </me>.
        The integer  <m>n</m>  is either even or it is odd.  We will show that it must be even by obtaining a contradiction if it assumed to be odd.  So, assume that  <m>n</m>  is odd.  (Now complete the proof.)

          <em>The Last Two Digits of a Large Integer</em>.
          Notice that <m>\mod{7,381,272}{72}{100}</m> since <m>7,381,272 - 72 = 7,381,200</m>,
          which is divisible by 100.
          In general, if we start with an integer whose decimal representation has more than two digits and subtract the integer formed by the last two digits,
          the result will be an integer whose last two digits are 00.
          This result will be divisible by 100.
          Hence, any integer with more than 2 digits is congruent modulo 100 to the integer formed by its last two digits.

                Determine the last two digits in the decimal representation of <m>4^{804}</m>. \hint One way is to determine the
                <q>mod 100 values</q>
                for <m>4^2</m>, <m>4^4</m>, <m>4^8</m>,
                <m>4^{16}</m>, <m>4^{32}</m>,
                <m>4^{64}</m>,<nbsp/>and so on.
                Then use these values and laws of exponents to determine <m>r</m>,
                where <m>4^{804} \equiv r \pmod {100}</m> and
                <m>r \in \mathbb{Z}</m> with <m>0 \leq r \lt 100</m>.
