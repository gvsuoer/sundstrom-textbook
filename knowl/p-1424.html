<p>In <a href="S_1direct.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.2: Constructing Direct Proofs">Section 1.2</a> and <a href="S_directproof.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.1: Direct Proofs">Section 3.1</a>, we studied direct proofs of mathematical statements. Most of the statements we prove in mathematics are conditional statements that can be written in the form <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\text{.}\)</span> A direct proof of a statement of the form <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> is based on the definition that a conditional statement can only be false when the hypothesis, <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> is true and the conclusion, <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> is false. Thus, if the conclusion is true whenever the hypothesis is true, then the conditional statement must be true. So, in a direct proof,</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>We start by assuming that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p>From this assumption, we logically deduce that <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">We have used the so-called forward and backward method to discover how to logically deduce <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> from the assumption that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true.</p>
