      The functions <m>k</m>, <m>F</m>,
      and <m>s</m> are injections.
      The functions <m>f</m> and <m>h</m> are not injections.

      The functions <m>f</m> and <m>s</m> are surjections.
      The functions <m>k</m> and <m>F</m> are not surjections.

      The function <m>f</m> is an injection but not a surjection.
      To see that it is an injection,
      let <m>a, b \in \R</m> and assume that <m>f(a) = f(b)</m>.
      This implies that <m>e^{-a} = e^{-b}</m>.
      Now use the natural logarithm function to prove that <m>a = b</m>.
      Since <m>e^{-x} > 0</m> for each real number <m>x</m>,
      there is no <m>x \in \R</m> such that <m>f(x) = -1</m>.
      So <m>f</m> is not a surjection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The function <m>g</m> is an injection and is a surjection.
      The proof that <m>g</m> is an injection is basically the same as the proof that <m>f</m> is an injection.
      To prove that <m>g</m> is a surjection, let <m>b \in \R^+</m>.
      To construct the real number <m>a</m> such that <m>g(a) = b</m>,
      solve the equation <m>e^{-a} = b</m> for <m>a</m>.
      The solution is <m>a = -\ln b</m>.
      It can then be verified that <m>g(a) = b</m>.

          There are several ordered pairs
          <m>(a, b) \in \R \times \R</m> such that <m>g(a, b) = 2</m>.
          For example, <m>g(0, 2) = 2</m>,
          <m>g(-1, 4) = 2</m>, and <m>g(2, -2) = 2</m>.

          For each <m>z \in \R</m>, <m>g(0, z) = z</m>.

          Part<nbsp/>(1) implies that the function <m>g</m> is not an injection.
          Part<nbsp/>(2) implies that the function <m>g</m> is a surjection since for each <m>z \in \R</m>,
          <m>(0, z)</m> is in the domain of <m>g</m> and <m>g(0, z) = z</m>.
