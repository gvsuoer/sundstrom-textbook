<p> The primary number system used in algebra and calculus is the <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">real number system</dfn>.  We usually use the symbol \(\mathbb{R}\) to stand for the set of all real numbers. The real numbers consist of the rational numbers  and the irrational numbers.  The <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">rational numbers</dfn> are those real numbers that can be written as a quotient of two integers (with a nonzero denominator), and the <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">irrational numbers</dfn> are those real numbers that cannot be written as a quotient of two integers. That is, a rational number can be written in the form of a fraction, and an irrational number cannot be written in the form of a fraction. Some common irrational numbers are \(\sqrt{2}\text{,}\) \(\pi\text{,}\) and \(e\text{.}\) We usually use the symbol \(\mathbb{Q}\) to represent the set of all rational numbers. (The letter \(\mathbb{Q}\) is used because rational numbers are quotients of integers.) There is no standard symbol for the set of all irrational numbers.</p>
