<p><span class="booktitle">Mathematical Reasoning: Writing and Proof</span> is designed to be a text for the first course in the college mathematics curriculum that introduces students to the processes of constructing and writing proofs and focuses on the formal development of mathematics. The primary goals of the text are to help students:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Develop logical thinking skills and to develop the ability to think more abstractly in a proof oriented setting.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop the ability to construct and write mathematical proofs using standard methods of mathematical proof including direct proofs, proof by contradiction, mathematical induction, case analysis, and counterexamples.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop the ability to read and understand written mathematical proofs.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop talents for creative thinking and problem solving.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve their quality of communication in mathematics. This includes improving writing techniques, reading comprehension, and oral communication in mathematics.</p></li>
<li><p>Better understand the nature of mathematics and its language.</p></li>
</ul>
