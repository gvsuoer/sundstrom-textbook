<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The first part of this theorem was proved in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_primefactors.html" title="Theorem 4.2.6">Theorem 4.2.6</a>. We will prove the second part of the theorem by induction on \(n\) using the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction. (See <a href="S_otherinduction.html" class="internal" title="Section 4.2: Other Forms of Mathematical Induction">Section 4.2</a>.) For each natural number \(n\) with \(n &gt; 1\text{,}\) let \(P( n )\) be <blockquote class="blockquote">If \(n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r\) and \(n = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_s\text{,}\) where \(p_1 , p_2 , \ldots, p_r\) and \(q_1 , q_2 , \ldots, q_s\) are primes with \(p_1 \leq p_2 \leq \cdots \leq p_r\) and \(q_1 \leq q_2 \leq \cdots \leq q_s\text{,}\) then \(r = s\text{,}\) and for each \(j\) from 1 to \(r\text{,}\) \(p_j = q_j\text{.}\)</blockquote></p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For the basis step, we notice that since 2 is a prime number, its only factorization is \(2 = 1 \cdot 2\text{.}\) This means that the only equation of the form \(2 = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r\text{,}\) where \(p_1 , p_2 , \ldots,
p_r\) are prime numbers, is the case where \(r = 1\) and \(p_1 = 2\text{.}\) This proves that \(P( 2 )\) is true.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For the inductive step, let \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) with \(k \geq 2\text{.}\) We will assume that \(P( 2 ), P( 3 ), \ldots , P( k )\) are true. The goal now is to prove that \(P( {k + 1} )\) is true. To prove this, we assume that \((k + 1)\) has two prime factorizations and then prove that these prime factorizations are the same. So we assume that <blockquote class="blockquote">\(k + 1 = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r\) and that \(k + 1 = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_s\text{,}\) where \(p_1 , p_2 , \ldots, p_r\) and \(q_1 , q_2 , \ldots, q_s\) are primes with \(p_1 \leq p_2 \leq \cdots \leq p_r\) and \(q_1 \leq q_2 \leq \cdots \leq q_s\text{.}\)</blockquote> We must now prove that \(r = s\text{,}\) and for each \(j\) from 1 to \(r\text{,}\) \(p_j = q_j\text{.}\) We can break our proof into two cases: (1) \(p_1 \leq q_1\text{;}\) and (2) \(q_1 \leq p_1\text{.}\) Since one of these must be true, and since the proofs will be similar, we can assume, without loss of generality, that \(p_1 \leq q_1\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Since \(k + 1 = p_1 p_2  \cdots p_r\text{,}\) we know that \(p_1 \mid \left( {k + 1} \right)\text{,}\) and hence we may conclude that \(p_1 \mid \left( {q_1 q_2  \cdots q_s } \right)\text{.}\) We now use <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/C_primedivides.html" title="Corollary 8.2.8">Corollary 8.2.8</a> to conclude that there exists a \(j\) with \(1 \leq j \leq s\) such that \(p_1 \mid q_j\text{.}\) Since \(p_1\) and \(q_j\) are primes, we conclude that</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
p_1  = q_j\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We have also assumed that \(q_1  \leq q_j\) for all \(j\) and, hence, we know that \(q_1  \leq p_1\text{.}\) However, we have also assumed that \(p_1  \leq q_1\text{.}\) Hence,</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
p_1  = q_1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We now use this and the fact that \(k + 1 = p_1 p_2  \cdots p_r  = q_1 q_2  \cdots q_s\) to conclude that</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
p_2  \cdots p_r  = q_2  \cdots q_s\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The product in the previous equation is less that \(k + 1\text{.}\) Hence, we can apply our induction hypothesis to these factorizations and conclude that \(r = s\text{,}\) and for each \(j\) from 2 to \(r\text{,}\) \(p_j = q_j\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This completes the proof that if \(P( 2 ), P( 3 ), \ldots , P( k )\) are true, then \(P( {k + 1} )\) is true. Hence, by the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction, we conclude that \(P( n )\) is true for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) with \(n \geq 2\text{.}\) This completes the proof of the theorem.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_primefactorizations.html#proof-52">in-context</a></span>
