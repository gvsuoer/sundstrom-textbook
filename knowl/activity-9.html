<div class="introduction">
<p>We have already seen examples of <dfn class="terminology">Pythagorean triples</dfn>, which are natural numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\text{.}\)</span> For example, 3, 4, and 5 form a Pythagorean triple as do 5, 12, and 13. One of the famous mathematicians of the 17th century was Pierre de Fermat (1601 — 1665). Fermat made an assertion that for each natural number <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(n \geq 3\text{,}\)</span> there are no positive integers <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(a^n + b^n = c^n\text{.}\)</span> This assertion was discovered in a margin of one of Fermat's books after his death, but Fermat provided no proof. He did, however, state that he had discovered a truly remarkable proof but the margin did not contain enough room for the proof.</p>
<p>This assertion became known as <dfn class="terminology">Fermat's Last Theorem</dfn> but it more properly should have been called Fermat's Last Conjecture. Despite the efforts of mathematicians, this “theorem” remained unproved until Andrew Wiles, a British mathematician, first announced a proof in June of 1993. However, it was soon recognized that this proof had a serious gap, but a widely accepted version of the proof was published by Wiles in 1995. Wiles' proof uses many concepts and techniques that were unknown at the time of Fermat. We cannot discuss the proof here, but we will explore and prove the following proposition, which is a (very) special case of Fermat's Last Theorem. <article class="assemblage assemblage-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Proposition.</span></h5>
<p>There do not exist prime numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> such that  <span class="process-math">\(a^3 + b^3 = c^3\text{.}\)</span></p></article> Although Fermat's Last Theorem implies this proposition is true, we will use a proof by contradiction to prove this proposition. For a proof by contradiction, we assume that <blockquote class="blockquote">there exist prime numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(a^3 + b^3 = c^3\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> Since 2 is the only even prime number, we will use the following cases: (1) <span class="process-math">\(a = b = 2\text{;}\)</span> (2) <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are both odd; and (3) one of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is odd and the other one is 2.</p>

<p>We now know that one of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> must be equal to 2. So we assume that <span class="process-math">\(b = 2\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is an odd prime. Substitute <span class="process-math">\(b = 2\)</span> into the equation <span class="process-math">\(b^3 = c^3 - a^3\)</span> and then factor the expression <span class="process-math">\(c^3 - a^3\text{.}\)</span> Use this to obtain a contradiction.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<p>Write a complete proof of the proposition.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_reviewproofs.html#activity-9">in-context</a></span>
