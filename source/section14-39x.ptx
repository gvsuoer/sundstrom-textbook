      Player Two has a winning strategy.
      On the <m>k</m>th turn,
      whatever symbol Player One puts in the <m>k</m>th position of the <m>k</m>th row, Player Two must put the other symbol in the <m>k</m>th position of his or her row.
      This guarantees that the row of symbols produced by Player Two will be different than any of the rows produced by Player One.

    <p>
      This is the same idea used in Cantor's Diagonal Argument.
      Once we have a
      <q>list</q>
      of real numbers in normalized form,
      we create a real number that is not in the list by making sure that its <m>k</m>th decimal place is different than the <m>k</m>th decimal place for the <m>k</m>th number in the list.
      The one complication is that we must make sure that our new real number does not have a decimal expression that ends in all 9's.
      This was done by using only 3's and 5's.

        <p>
          <proof>
            <p>
              In order to find a bijection <m>f\x  ( 0, 1 ) \to ( a, b )</m>,
              we will use the linear function through the points <m>( 0, a )</m> and <m>( 1, b )</m>.
              The slope is <m>( b - a)</m> and the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>( 0, a )</m>.
              So define <m>f\x  ( 0, 1 ) \to ( a, b )</m> by <m>f ( x ) = ( b - a )x + a</m>,
              for each <m>x \in ( 0, 1 )</m>.
              Now, if <m>x,
              t \in ( 0, 1 )</m> and <m>f ( x ) = f ( t )</m>, then
              <me>
                ( b - a )x + a = ( b - a )t + a
              </me>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This implies that <m>( b - a )x = ( b - a )t</m>,
              and since <m>b - a \ne 0</m>,
              we can conclude that <m>x = t</m>.
              Therefore, <m>f</m> is an injection.
            </p>
            <p>
              To prove that <m>f</m> is a surjection,
              we let <m>y \in ( a, b )</m>.
              If <m>x = \dfrac{y - a}{b - a}</m>, then
              <me>
                \begin{aligned}f ( x ) \amp = f \!\left( \frac{y - a}{b - a} \right) \\ \amp = ( b - a ) \!\left( \frac{y - a}{b - a} \right) + a \\ \amp = ( y - a ) + a \\ \amp = y \end{aligned}
              </me>
            </p>
            <p>
              This proves that <m>f</m> is a surjection.
              Hence, <m>f</m> is a bijection and <m>( 0, 1 ) \approx ( a, b )</m>.
              Therefore, <m>( a, b )</m> is uncountable and has cardinality <m>\boldsymbol{c}</m>.
            </p>
          </proof>
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          Now, if <m>a,
          b, c, d</m> are real numbers with <m>a \lt b</m> and <m>c \lt d</m>,
          then we know that <m>( a, b ) \approx ( 0, 1 )</m> and <m>( c, d ) \approx ( 0, 1 )</m>.
          Since <m>\approx</m> is an equivalence relation,we can conclude that <m>( a, b ) \approx ( c, d )</m>.
