</h4>
<div class="introduction">
<p>In elementary mathematics, the notion of an ordered pair introduced at the beginning of this section will suffice. However, if we are interested in a formal development of the Cartesian product of two sets, we need a more precise definition of ordered pair. Following is one way to do this in terms of sets. This definition is credited to Kazimierz Kuratowski (1896 — 1980). Kuratowski was a famous Polish mathematician whose main work was in the areas of topology and set theory. He was appointed the Director of the Polish Academy of Sciences and served in that position for 19 years. Let  <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>  be an element of the set  <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> and let  <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>  be an element of the set  <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> The <dfn class="terminology">ordered pair</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(\left( {x,y} \right)\)</span> is defined to be the set <span class="process-math">\(\left\{ {\left\{ x \right\},\left\{ {x,y} \right\}} \right\}\text{.}\)</span> That is,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\left( {x,y} \right) = \left\{ {\left\{ x \right\},\left\{ {x,y} \right\}} \right\}\!\text{.}
\end{equation*}

<p>Explain how this definition allows us to distinguish between the ordered pairs <span class="process-math">\(\left( {3,5} \right)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\left( {5,3} \right)\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> be sets and let <span class="process-math">\(a,c \in A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b,d \in B\text{.}\)</span> Use this definition of an ordered pair and the concept of set equality to prove that <span class="process-math">\(\left( {a,b} \right) = \left( {c,d} \right)\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(a = c\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b = d\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>An <dfn class="terminology">ordered triple</dfn> can be thought of as a single triple of objects, denoted by  <span class="process-math">\(\left( {a,b,c} \right)\text{,}\)</span> with an implied order.  This means that in order for two ordered triples to be equal, they must contain exactly the same objects in the same order.  That is, <span class="process-math">\(\left( {a,b,c} \right) = \left( {p,q,r} \right)\)</span> if and only if  <span class="process-math">\(a = p\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b = q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c = r\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> be sets, and let <span class="process-math">\(x \in A,y \in B,\text{ and } z \in C\text{.}\)</span> Write a set theoretic definition of the ordered triple <span class="process-math">\(\left( {x,y,z} \right)\)</span> similar to the set theoretic definition of “ordered pair.”</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_cartesian.html#exer_defoforderedpair" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
