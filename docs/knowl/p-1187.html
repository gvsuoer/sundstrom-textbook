<p>Surprising to some is the fact that in mathematics, there are always <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">undefined terms</dfn>.  This is because if we tried to define everything, we would end up going in circles. Simply put, we must start somewhere. For example, in Euclidean geometry, the terms “point,” “line,” and “contains” are undefined terms. In this text, we are using our number systems such as the natural numbers and integers as undefined terms. We often assume that these undefined objects satisfy certain properties. These assumed relationships are accepted as true without proof and are called axioms (or postulates). An <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">axiom</dfn>  is a mathematical statement that is accepted without proof. Euclidean geometry starts with undefined terms and a set of postulates and axioms. For example, the following statement is an axiom of Euclidean geometry: <blockquote class="blockquote">Given any two distinct points, there is exactly one line that contains these two points.</blockquote></p>
