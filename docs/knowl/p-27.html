<p>One of the motivating factors for writing this book was to develop a textbook for the course “Communicating in Mathematics” at Grand Valley State University. This course is part of the university's Supplemental Writing Skills Program, and there was no text that dealt with writing issues in mathematics that was suitable for this course. This is why some of the writing guidelines in the text deal with the use of <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> or a word processor that is capable of producing the appropriate mathematical symbols and equations. However, the writing guidelines can easily be implemented for courses where students do not have access to this type of word processing.</p>
