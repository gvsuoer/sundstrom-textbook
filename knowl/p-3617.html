<p>One of the most important concepts in modern mathematics is that of a <dfn class="terminology">function</dfn>. In previous mathematics courses, we have often thought of a function as some sort of input-output rule that assigns exactly one output to each input. So in this context, a <dfn class="terminology">function</dfn> can be thought of as a procedure for associating with each element of some set, called the <dfn class="terminology">domain of the function</dfn>, exactly one element of another set, called the <dfn class="terminology">codomain of the function</dfn>. This procedure can be considered an input-output rule. The function takes the input, which is an element of the domain, and produces an output, which is an element of the codomain. In calculus and precalculus, the inputs and outputs were almost always real numbers. So the notation <span class="process-math">\(f( x ) = x^2 \sin x\)</span> means the following:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is the name of the function.</p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="process-math">\(f( x )\)</span> is a real number. It is the output of the function when the input is the real number  <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> For example,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
f\left( {\frac{\pi }{2}} \right) \amp = \left( {\frac{\pi }{2}} \right)^2 
\sin \left( {\frac{\pi } {2}} \right)\\
\amp = \frac{{\pi ^2 }}{4} \cdot 1\\
\amp = \frac{{\pi ^2 }}{4}\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">For this function, it is understood that the domain of the function is the set <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> of all real numbers. In this situation, we think of the domain as the set of all possible inputs. That is, the domain is the set of all possible real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for which a real number output can be determined.</p>
