<p>It may seem that we have done a lot of work to prove an “obvious” result in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_equivfinitesets.html" title="Theorem 9.3">Theorem 9.3</a>. The same may be true of the remaining results in this section, which give further results about finite sets. One of the goals is to make sure that the concept of cardinality for a finite set corresponds to our intuitive notion of the number of elements in the set. Another important goal is to lay the groundwork for a more rigorous and mathematical treatment of infinite sets than we have encountered before. Along the way, we will see the mathematical distinction between finite and infinite sets.</p>
