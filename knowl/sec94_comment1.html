<p>We have now seen that any open interval of real numbers is uncountable and has cardinality <span class="process-math">\(\boldsymbol{c}\text{.}\)</span> In addition, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is uncountable and has cardinality <span class="process-math">\(\boldsymbol{c}\text{.}\)</span> Now, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/C_cantor.html" title="Corollary 9.33">Corollary 9.33</a> tells us that <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} )\)</span> is uncountable. A question that can be asked is, “Does <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} )\)</span> have the same cardinality as <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\text{?}\)</span>” The answer is yes, although we are not in a position to prove it yet. A proof of this fact uses the following theorem, which is known as the Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein Theorem.</p>

<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> be sets. If there exist injections <span class="process-math">\(f\x A \to B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\x B \to A\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(A \approx B\text{.}\)</span></p></article><p>In the statement of this theorem, notice that it is not required that the function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> be the inverse of the function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> We will not prove the Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein Theorem here. The following items will show some uses of this important theorem.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_uncountablesets.html#sec94_comment1" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
