<p>We will use a proof by contradiction. So we assume that the statement of the theorem is false. That is, we assume that <blockquote class="blockquote">
<span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is a real number, <span class="process-math">\(r^2 = 2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is a rational number.</blockquote></p>
<p>Since <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is a rational number, there exist integers <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(n &gt; 0\)</span> such that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
r = \frac{m}{n}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">and <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> have no common factor greater than 1. We will obtain a contradiction by showing that <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> must both be even. Squaring both sides of the last equation and using the fact that <span class="process-math">\(r^2 = 2\text{,}\)</span> we obtain</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align}
2 \amp = \frac{{m^2 }}{{n^2 }} \amp\tag{8}\\
m^2  \amp = 2n^2\tag{9}
\end{align}
</div>
<p>Equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_3h.html" title="Equation 9">(9)</a> implies that <span class="process-math">\(m^2\)</span> is even, and hence, by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_n2odd.html" title="Theorem 3.8">Theorem 3.8</a>, <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> must be an even integer. This means that there exists an integer <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(m = 2p\text{.}\)</span> We can now substitute this into equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_3h.html" title="Equation 9">(9)</a>, which gives</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eq_3h.html ./knowl/T_n2odd.html ./knowl/eq_3h.html">
\begin{align}
\left( {2p} \right)^2  \amp = 2n^2 \amp \notag\\
4p^2  \amp = 2n^2\tag{10}
\end{align}
</div>
<p>We can divide both sides of equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_3i.html" title="Equation 10">(10)</a> by 2 to obtain <span class="process-math">\(n^2 = 2p^2\text{.}\)</span> Consequently, <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is even and we can once again use <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_n2odd.html" title="Theorem 3.8">Theorem 3.8</a> to conclude that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is an even integer.</p>
<p>We have now established that both <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> are even. This means that 2 is a common factor of <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> which contradicts the assumption that <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> have no common factor greater than 1. Consequently, the statement of the theorem cannot be false, and we have proved that if <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is a real number such that <span class="process-math">\(r^2 = 2\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is an irrational number.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_contradiction.html#proof-13" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
