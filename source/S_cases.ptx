      <title>Using Cases in a Proof</title>
      <p>
        The work in Beginning  <xref ref="PA_logicalequiv"></xref>
        was meant to introduce the idea of using cases in a proof.
        The method of using cases is often used when the hypothesis of the proposition is a disjunction.
        This is justified by the logical equivalency

        In some other situations when we are trying to prove a proposition or a theorem about an element <m>x</m> in some set <m>U</m>,
        we often run into the problem that there does not seem to be enough information about <m>x</m> to proceed.
        For example, consider the following proposition:
      </p>
      <p>
        <term>Proposition 1</term>.
        If <m>n</m> is an integer,
        then <m>\left( n^2 + n \right)</m> is an even integer.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we were trying to write a direct proof of this proposition,
        the only thing we could assume is that <m>n</m> is an integer.
        This is not much help.
        In a situation such as this,
        we will sometimes use cases to provide additional assumptions for the forward process of the proof.
        Cases are usually based on some common properties that the element <m>x</m> may or may not possess.
        The cases must be chosen so that they exhaust all possibilities for the object <m>x</m> in the hypothesis of the original proposition.
        For Proposition<nbsp/>1,
        we know that an integer must be even or it must be odd.
        We can thus use the following two cases for the integer <m>n</m>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The integer <m>n</m> is an even integer;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The integer <m>n</m> is an odd integer.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Complete the proof for the following proposition:
              <em>Proposition 2:</em> If <m>n</m> is an even integer,
              then <m>n^2 + n</m> is an even integer.
              <em><em>Proof</em></em>.
              Let <m>n</m> be an even integer.
              Then there exists an integer <m>m</m> such that <m>n = 2m</m>.
              Substituting this into the expression <m>n^2 + n</m> yields <ellipsis/> .

    <title>Writing Guidelines for a Proof Using Cases</title>
    <p>
      When writing a proof that uses cases,
      we use all the other writing guidelines.
      In addition,
      we make sure that it is clear where each case begins.
      This can be done by using a new paragraph with a label such as
      <q>Case 1,</q>
      or it can be done by starting a paragraph with a phrase such as,
      <q>In the case where <ellipsis/>.</q>
    </p>
    <investigation xml:id="pr_n-even-odd">
      <title>Using Cases: $\boldsymbol{n}$ Is Even or $\boldsymbol{n}$ Is Odd</title>
      <p>
        Complete the proof of the following proposition:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Proposition</em>.
        <em>For each integer <m>n</m>,
        <m>n^2 - 5n + 7</m> is an odd integer</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em><em>Proof</em></em>.
        Let <m>n</m> be an integer.
        We will prove that <m>n^2 - 5n + 7</m> is an odd integer by examining the case where <m>n</m> is even and the case where <m>n</m> is odd.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Case 1</em>.
        The integer <m>n</m> is even.
        In this case,
        there exists an integer <m>m</m> such that <m>n = 2m</m>.
        Therefore, <ellipsis/> .
      </p>
    </investigation>
    <p>
      As another example of using cases,
      consider a situation where we know that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are real numbers and <m>ab = 0</m>.
      If we want to make a conclusion about <m>b</m>,
      the temptation might be to divide both sides of the equation by <m>a</m>.
      However, we can only do this if <m>a \ne 0</m>.
      So, we consider two cases:
      one when <m>a = 0</m> and the other when <m>a \ne 0</m>.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop_zeroproperty">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For all real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
          if <m>ab = 0</m>, then <m>a = 0</m> or <m>b = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be real numbers and assume that <m>ab = 0</m>.
        We will prove that <m>a = 0</m> or <m>b = 0</m> by considering two cases: (1) <m>a = 0</m>,
        and (2) <m>a \ne 0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case where <m>a = 0</m>,
        the conclusion of the proposition is true and so there is nothing to prove.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case where <m>a \ne 0</m>,
        we can multiply both sides of the equation <m>ab = 0</m> by <m>\dfrac{1}{a}</m> and obtain
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}\frac{1}{a} \cdot ab \amp = \frac{1}{a} \cdot 0 \\ b \amp  = 0. \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        So in both cases, <m>a = 0</m> or <m>b = 0</m>,
        and this proves that for all real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
        if <m>ab = 0</m>, then <m>a = 0</m> or <m>b = 0</m>.

    <title>Absolute Value</title>
    <p>
      Most students by now have studied the concept of the absolute value of a real number.
      We use the notation <m>\left| x \right|</m> to stand for the absolute value of the real number <m>x</m>.
      One way to think of the absolute value of <m>x</m> is as the
      <q>distance</q>
      between <m>x</m> and 0 on the number line.
      For example,
      <me>
        \left| 5 \right| = 5  \text{ and }   \left| -7 \right| = 7
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although this notion of absolute value is convenient for determining the absolute value of a specific number,
      if we want to prove properties about absolute value,
      we need a more careful and precise definition.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="D_absvalue">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>x \in \R</m>, we define <m>\left| x \right|</m>,
          called the <term>absolute value of </term>
          <term><term>x</term></term>,
              <idx><h>absolute value|(</h></idx>
          by
          <men>
            \left| x \right| = \begin{cases}x,    \amp   \text{ if \(x \geq 0\); }  \\ -x    \amp   \text{ if \(x \lt  0\). } \end{cases}
          </men>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Let's first see if this definition is consistent with our intuitive notion of absolute value by looking at two specific examples.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>5 > 0</m>, we see that <m>\left| 5 \right| = 5</m>,
            which should be no surprise.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>-7 \lt 0</m>,
            we see that <m>\left| -7 \right| = - \left( -7 \right) = 7</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that the definition of the absolute value of <m>x</m> is given in two parts,
      one for when <m>x \geq 0</m> and the other for when <m>x \lt 0</m>.
      This means that when attempting to prove something about absolute value,
      we often uses cases.
      This will be illustrated in <xref ref="P_absvalue">Theorem</xref>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="P_absvalue">

      <p>
        The proof of Part<nbsp/><xref ref="P_absvalue-2"/> is part of Exercise<nbsp/><xref ref="exer_absvalue"/>.
        We will prove Part<nbsp/><xref ref="P_absvalue-1"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We let <m>a</m> be a positive real number and let <m>x \in \R</m>.
        We will first prove that if <m>|x| = a</m>,
        then <m>x = a</m> or <m>x = -a</m>.
        So we assume that <m>\left| x \right| = a</m>.
        In the case where <m>x \geq 0</m>,
        we see that <m>\left| x \right| = x</m>,
        and since <m>\left| x \right| = a</m>,
        we can conclude that <m>x = a</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case where <m>x \lt 0</m>,
        we see that <m>\left| x \right| = -x</m>.
        Since <m>\left| x \right| = a</m>,
        we can conclude that <m>-x = a</m> and hence that <m>x = -a</m>.
        These two cases prove that if <m>\left| x \right| = a</m>,
        then <m>x = a</m> or <m>x = -a</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will now prove that if <m>x = a</m> or <m>x = -a</m>,
        then <m>|x| = a</m>.
        We start by assuming that <m>x = a</m> or <m>x = -a</m>.
        Since the hypothesis of this conditional statement is a disjunction,
        we use two cases.
        When <m>x = a</m>, we see that
        <me>
          \left| x \right| = \left| a \right| = a  \text{ since }  a > 0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When <m>x = -a</m>, we conclude that
        <me>
          \left| x \right| = \left| -a \right| = - \left( -a  \right)  \text{ since }  -a \lt  0

    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will prove Part<nbsp/><xref ref="T_absvalue-1"/>.
        The proof of Part<nbsp/><xref ref="T_absvalue-2"/> is included in Exercise<nbsp/><xref ref="exer_absvalue"/>,
        and the proof of Part<nbsp/><xref ref="T_absvalue-3"/> is Exercise<nbsp/><xref ref="exer_triangleineq"/>.
        For Part<nbsp/><xref ref="T_absvalue-1"/>,
        we will prove the biconditional proposition by proving the two associated conditional propositions.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we let <m>a</m> be a positive real number and let
        <m>x \in \R</m> and first assume that <m>\left| x \right| \lt a</m>.
        We will use two cases: either <m>x \geq 0</m> or <m>x \lt 0</m>.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              In the case where <m>x \geq 0</m>,
              we know that <m>\left| x \right| = x</m> and so the inequality
              <m>\left| x \right| \lt a</m> implies that <m>x \lt a</m>.
              However, we also know that
              <m>-a \lt 0</m> and that <m>x > 0</m>.
              Therefore, we conclude that <m>-a \lt x</m> and,
              hence, <m>-a \lt x \lt a</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              When <m>x \lt 0</m>, we see that <m>\left| x \right| = -x</m>.
              Therefore, the inequality <m>\left| x \right| \lt a</m> implies that <m>-x \lt a</m>,
              which in turn implies that <m>-a \lt x</m>.
              In this case,
              we also know that <m>x \lt a</m> since <m>x</m> is negative and <m>a</m> is positive.
              Hence, <m>-a \lt x \lt a</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        So in both cases, we have proven that
        <m>-a \lt x \lt a</m> and this proves that if <m>\left| x \right| \lt a</m>,
        then <m>-a \lt x \lt a</m>.
        We now assume that <m>-a \lt x \lt a</m>.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>x \geq 0</m>, then <m>\left| x \right| = x</m> and hence,
              <m>\left| x \right| \lt a</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>x \lt 0</m>,
              then <m>\left| x \right| = -x</m> and so <m>x = -\left| x \right|</m>.
              Thus, <m>-a \lt - \left| x \right|</m>.
              By multiplying both sides of the last inequality by <m>-1</m>,
              we conclude that <m>\left| x \right| \lt a</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        These two cases prove that if <m>-a \lt x \lt a</m>,
        then <m>\left| x \right| \lt a</m>.
        Hence, we have proven that
        <m>\left| x \right| \lt a</m> if and only if <m>-a \lt x \lt a</m>.
      </p>

      <em>Proposition</em>.
      For all nonzero integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
      if <m>a + 2b \ne 3</m> and <m>9a + 2b \ne 1</m>,
      then the equation <m>ax^3 + 2bx = 3</m> does not have a solution that is a natural number.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will prove the contrapositive,
        which is: For all nonzero integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
        if the equation <m>ax^3 + 2bx = 3</m> has a solution that is a natural number,
        then <m>a + 2b = 3</m> or <m>9a + 2b = 1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be nonzero integers and assume that the natural number <m>n</m> is a solution of the equation <m>ax^3 + 2bx = 3</m>.
        So we have
        <md>
          <mrow>an^3 + 2bn \amp = 3 \qquad \text{ or }</mrow>
          <mrow>n \left( an^2 + 2b \right) \amp = 3</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we can conclude that <m>n = 3</m> and <m>an^2 + 2b = 1</m>.
        Since we now have the value of <m>n</m>,
        we can substitute it in the equation
        <m>an^3 + 2bn = 3</m> and obtain <m>27a + 6b = 3</m>.
        Dividing both sides of this equation by 3 shows that <m>9a + 2b = 1</m>.
        So there is no need for us to go any further,
        and this concludes the proof of the contrapositive of the proposition.

      <em>Proposition</em>.
      For all nonzero integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
      if <m>a + 2b \ne 3</m> and <m>9a + 2b \ne 1</m>,
      then the equation <m>ax^3 + 2bx = 3</m> does not have a solution that is a natural number.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will use a proof by contradiction.
        Let us assume that there exist nonzero integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> such that <m>a + 2b = 3</m> and
        <m>9a + 2b = 1</m> and <m>an^3 + 2bn = 3</m>,
        where <m>n</m> is a natural number.
        First, we will solve one equation for <m>2b</m>;
        doing this, we obtain
        <md>
          <mrow>a + 2b \amp = 3</mrow>
          <mrow>2b \amp = 3 - a</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can now substitute for <m>2b</m> in <m>an^3 + 2bn = 3</m>.
        This gives
        <md>
          <mrow>an^3 + (3 - a)n \amp = 3</mrow>
          <mrow>an^3 + 3n - an  \amp = 3</mrow>
          <mrow>n \left( an^2 + 3 - a \right) \amp = 3</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the closure properties of the integers,
        <m>\left( an^2 + 3 - a \right)</m> is an integer and, hence,
        equation<nbsp/>(2) implies that <m>n</m> divides 3.
        So <m>n = 1</m> or <m>n = 3</m>.
        When we substitute <m>n = 1</m> into the equation <m>an^3 + 2bn = 3</m>,
        we obtain <m>a + 2b = 3</m>.
        This is a contradiction since we are told in the proposition that <m>a + 2b \ne 3</m>.
        This proves that the negation of the proposition is false and,
        hence, the proposition is true.
