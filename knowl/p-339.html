<p> We now focus our effort on proving statement <span class="process-math">\(Q1\)</span> since we know that if we can prove <span class="process-math">\(Q1\text{,}\)</span> then we can conclude that <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true. We ask a backward question about <span class="process-math">\(Q1\)</span> such as, “How can we prove that there exists an integer <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x \cdot y = 2q + 1\text{?}\)</span>” We may not have a ready answer for this question, and so we look at the know portion of the table and try to connect the know portion to the show portion. To do this, we work forward from step <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> and this involves asking a <dfn class="terminology">forward question.</dfn> The basic form of this type of question is, “What can we conclude from the fact that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true?” In this case, we can use the definition of an odd integer to conclude that there exist integers <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x = 2m + 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y = 2n + 1\text{.}\)</span> We will call this Step <span class="process-math">\(P1\)</span> in the know-show table. It is important to notice that we were careful not to use the letter <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> to denote these integers. If we had used <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> again, we would be claiming that the same integer that gives <span class="process-math">\(x \cdot y = 2q + 1\)</span> also gives <span class="process-math">\(x = 2q + 1\text{.}\)</span> This is why we used <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> for the integers <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> since there is no guarantee that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> equals <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> The basic rule of thumb is to use a different symbol for each new object we introduce in a proof. So at this point, we have: <blockquote class="blockquote">Step <span class="process-math">\(P1\text{.}\)</span> We know that there exist integers <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x = 2m + 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y = 2n + 1\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">Step <span class="process-math">\(Q1\text{.}\)</span> We need to prove that there exists an integer <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x \cdot y = 2q + 1\text{.}\)</span>
