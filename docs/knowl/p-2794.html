<p>The symbol <span class="process-math">\(\in\)</span> is used to describe a relationship between an element of the universal set and a subset of the universal set, and the symbol <span class="process-math">\(\subseteq\)</span> is used to describe a relationship between two subsets of the universal set. For example, the number 5 is an integer, and so it is appropriate to write <span class="process-math">\(5 \in \mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span> It is not appropriate, however, to write <span class="process-math">\(5 \subseteq \mathbb{Z}\)</span> since 5 is not a set. It is important to distinguish between 5 and <span class="process-math">\(\left\{ 5 \right\}\text{.}\)</span> The difference is that 5 is an integer and <span class="process-math">\(\left\{ 5 \right\}\)</span> is a set consisting of one element. Consequently, it is appropriate to write <span class="process-math">\(\left\{ 5 \right\} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}\text{,}\)</span> but it is not appropriate to write <span class="process-math">\(\left\{ 5 \right\} \in \mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span> The distinction between these two symbols <span class="process-math">\(\left( 5 \text{ and } \left\{ 5 \right\} \right)\)</span> is important when we discuss what is called the power set of a given set.</p>
