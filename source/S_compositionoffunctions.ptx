    <title>Composition of Functions</title>
    <p>
      There are several ways to combine two existing functions to create a new function.
      For example, in calculus,
      we learned how to form the product and quotient of two functions and then how to use the product rule to determine the derivative of a product of two functions and the quotient rule to determine the derivative of the quotient of two functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chain rule in calculus was used to determine the derivative of the composition of two functions,
      and in this section,
      we will focus only on the composition of two functions.
      We will then consider some results about the compositions of injections and surjections.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic idea of function composition is that when possible,
      the output of a function <m>f</m> is used as the input of a function <m>g</m>.
      This can be referred to as
      <q><m>f</m> followed by <m>g</m></q>
      and is called the composition of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.
      In previous mathematics courses,
      we used this idea to determine a formula for the composition of two real functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if
      <me>
        f( x ) = 3x^2  + 2  \text{ and }   g( x ) = \sin x
      </me>,
      then we can compute <m>g( f( x ) )</m> as follows:
      <me>
        \begin{aligned} g( {f( x )} ) \amp = g \! \left( {3x^2  + 2} \right) \\ \amp = \sin \! \left( {3x^2  + 2} \right). \end{aligned}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, <m>f( x )</m>,
      the output of the function <m>f</m>,
      was used as the input for the function <m>g</m>.
      We now give the formal definition of the composition of two functions.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="functioncomposition">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> be nonempty sets,
          and let <m>f\x A \to B</m> and <m>g\x B \to C</m> be functions.

            ( {g \circ f} )( x ) = g\left( {f( x )} \right)
          </me>
          for all <m>x \in A</m>.
          We often refer to the function <m>g \circ f</m> as a
          <term>composite function</term>.

      It is helpful to think of the composite function <m>g \circ f</m> as
      <q><m>\boldsymbol{f}</m> <em>followed by</em>
      <m>\boldsymbol{g}</m>.</q>
      We then refer to <m>f</m> as the

    <title>Composition and Arrow Diagrams</title>
    <p>
      The concept of the composition of two functions can be illustrated with arrow diagrams when the domain and codomain of the functions are small,
      finite sets.
      Although the term
      <q>composition</q>
      was not used then,
      this was done in <xref ref="PA_compositionintro"></xref>,
      and another example is given here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>A = \left\{ {a, b, c, d} \right\}</m>,
      <m>B = \left\{ {p, q, r} \right\}</m>,
      and <m>C = \left\{ {s, t, u, v} \right\}</m>.
      The arrow diagram in <xref ref="fig_arrow64-1"></xref> shows two functions:
      <m>f\x A \to B</m> and <m>g\x B \to C</m>.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      If we follow the arrows from the set <m>A</m> to the set <m>C</m>,
      we will use the outputs of <m>f</m> as inputs of <m>g</m>,
      and get the arrow diagram from <m>A</m> to <m>C</m> shown in <xref ref="fig_arrow64-2"></xref>.
      This diagram represents the composition of <m>f</m> followed by <m>g</m>.

    <title>Decomposing Functions</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>decomposing functions</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      We use the <em>chain rule</em>
          <idx><h>chain rule</h></idx>
      in calculus to find the derivative of a composite function.
      The first step in the process is to recognize a given function as a composite function.
      This can be done in many ways,
      but the work in <xref ref="PA_verbaldescriptions"></xref>
      can be used to decompose a function in a way that works well with the chain rule.
      The use of the terms
      <q>inner function</q>
      and
      <q>outer function</q>
      can also be helpful.
      The idea is that we use the last step in the process to represent the outer function,
      and the steps prior to that to represent the inner function.
      So for the function,
      <me>
        f\x \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\text{  by  } f( x ) = ( {3x + 2} )^3
      </me>,
      the last step in the verbal description table was to cube the result.
      This means that we will use the function <m>g</m>
      (the cubing function)
      as the outer function and will use the prior steps as the inner function.
      We will denote the inner function by <m>h</m>.
      So we let <m>h\x \R \to \R</m> by <m>h( x ) = 3x + 2</m> and
      <m>g\x \R \to \R</m> by <m>g( x ) = x^3</m>.
      Then
      <md>
        <mrow>( {g \circ h} )( x ) \amp = g\left( {h( x )} \right)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = g( {3x + 2} )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = ( {3x + 2} )^3</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = f( x )</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We see that <m>g \circ h = f</m> and, hence, we have
      <q>decomposed</q>
      the function <m>f</m>.
      It should be noted that there are other ways to write the function <m>f</m> as a composition of two functions,
      but the way just described is the one that works well with the chain rule.
      In this case, the chain rule gives
      <md>
        <mrow>f'(x) \amp = ( g \circ h )'(x)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = g'(h(x))\; h'(x)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 3(h(x))^2 \cdot 3</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 9 (3x + 2)^2</mrow>

    <p>
      The proof of <xref ref="T_compositefunctions1"/> is <xref ref="exer_compositefunctions1"/>.
      <xref ref="T_compositefunctions3"/> is a direct consequence of the first two parts.
      We will discuss a process for constructing a proof of <xref ref="T_compositefunctions2"/>.
      Using the forward-backward process,
      we first look at the conclusion of the conditional statement in <xref ref="T_compositefunctions2"/>.
      The goal is to prove that <m>g \circ f</m> is a surjection.
      Since <m>g \circ f\x A \to C</m>,
      this is equivalent to proving that
    </p>
    <p>
      For all <m>c \in C</m>,
      there exists an <m>a \in A</m> such that <m>( {g \circ f} )( a ) = c</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this statement in the backward process uses a universal quantifier,
      we will use the choose-an-element method and choose an arbitrary element <m>c</m> in the set <m>C</m>.
      The goal now is to find an <m>a \in A</m> such that <m>( {g \circ f} )( a ) = c</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we can look at the hypotheses.
      In particular, we are assuming that both
      <m>f\x A \to B</m> and <m>g\x B \to C</m> are surjections.
      Since we have chosen <m>c \in C</m>,
      and <m>g\x B \to C</m> is a surjection, we know that
    </p>
    <p>
      there exists a <m>b \in B</m> such that <m>g( b ) = c</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, <m>b \in B</m> and <m>f\x A \to B</m> is a surjection.
      Hence
    </p>
    <p>
      there exists an <m>a \in A</m> such that <m>f( a ) = b</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we now compute <m>( {g \circ f} )( a )</m>, we will see that
      <me>
        ( {g \circ f} )( a ) = g \left( f ( a ) \right) = g ( b ) = c
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can now write the proof as follows: \eighth
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Proof of <xref ref="T_compositefunctions"></xref>, <xref ref="T_compositefunctions2"/>.</em> Let <m>A</m>,
      <m>B</m>,
      and <m>C</m> be nonempty sets and assume that <m>f\x A \to B</m> and
      <m>g\x B \to C</m> are both surjections.
      We will prove that <m>g \circ f\x A \to C</m> is a surjection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>c</m> be an arbitrary element of <m>C</m>.
      We will prove there exists an <m>a \in A</m> such that <m>( g \circ f ) ( a ) = c</m>.
      Since <m>g\x B \to C</m> is a surjection, we conclude that
    </p>
    <p>
      there exists a <m>b \in B</m> such that <m>g( b ) = c</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, <m>b \in B</m> and <m>f\x A \to B</m> is a surjection.
      Hence
    </p>
    <p>
      there exists an <m>a \in A</m> such that <m>f( a ) = b</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now see that
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}( {g \circ f} )( a ) \amp = g\left( {f( a )} \right) \\ \amp = g( b ) \\ \amp = c. \end{aligned}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now shown that for every <m>c \in C</m>,
      there exists an <m>a \in A</m> such that <m>( {g \circ f} )( a ) = c</m>,
      and this proves that <m>g \circ f</m> is a surjection.
    </p>

      <xref ref="T_compositefunctions"></xref>
      shows us that if <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are both special types of functions,
      then the composition of <m>f</m> followed by <m>g</m> is also that type of function.
      The next question is,
      <q>If the composition of <m>f</m> followed by <m>g</m> is an injection
      (or surjection),
      can we make any conclusions about <m>f</m> or <m>g</m>?</q>
      A partial answer to this question is provided in <xref ref="T_morecompositefunctions"></xref>.

          it may be useful to draw your arrow diagrams in a triangular arrangement as follows:
          <figure>
            <image width="73%" source="images/figps-comparrow.png"/>
          </figure>
          It might be helpful to consider examples where the sets are small.
          Try constructing examples where the set <m>A</m> has 2 elements,
          the set <m>B</m> has 3 elements,
          and the set <m>C</m> has 2 elements.
