<p>The <dfn class="terminology">Pythagorean Theorem</dfn> for right triangles states that if <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is the length of the hypotenuse, then <span class="process-math">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\)</span> For example, if <span class="process-math">\(a = 5\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b = 12\)</span> are the lengths of the two sides of a right triangle and if <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is the length of the hypotenuse, then the <span class="process-math">\(c^2 = 5^2 + 12^2\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(c^2 = 169\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is a length and must be positive, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(c = 13\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Construct and provide a well-written proof for the following proposition. <blockquote class="blockquote">Proposition: If <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is a real number and <span class="process-math">\(m\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(m + 1\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m + 2\)</span> are the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle, then <span class="process-math">\(m = 3\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote></p>
<p>Although this proposition uses different mathematical concepts than the one used in this section, the process of constructing a proof for this proposition is the same forward-backward method that was used to construct a proof for <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_xyodd.html" title="Theorem 1.10">Theorem 1.10</a>. However, the backward question, “How do we prove that <span class="process-math">\(m = 3\text{?}\)</span>” is simple but may be difficult to answer. The basic idea is to develop an equation from the forward process and show that <span class="process-math">\(m = 3\)</span> is a solution of that equation.</p>
