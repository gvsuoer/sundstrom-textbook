<p>We will now consider the following situation: Let <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> be sets and let <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> be a function from <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> Also, let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> be subsets of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> be subsets of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> In the remainder of this section, we will consider the following situations and answer the questions posed in each case.</p>
<ul class="disc">

<p>The set <span class="process-math">\(A \cap B\)</span> is a subset of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(f ( A \cap B )\)</span> is a subset of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> In addition, <span class="process-math">\(f ( A )\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f ( B )\)</span> are subsets of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> Hence, <span class="process-math">\(f ( A ) \cap f ( B )\)</span> is a subset of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span></p>
