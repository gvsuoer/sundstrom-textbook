<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> be nonempty sets and let <span class="process-math">\(f\x A \to B\text{.}\)</span> We will first assume that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a bijection and prove that <span class="process-math">\(f^{ - 1}\)</span> is a function from <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> To do this, we will show that <span class="process-math">\(f^{ - 1}\)</span> satisfies the two conditions of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_functionasordered.html" title="Theorem 6.31">Theorem 6.31</a>.</p>
<p>We first choose <span class="process-math">\(b \in B\text{.}\)</span> Since the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a surjection, there exists an <span class="process-math">\(a \in A\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f( a ) = b\text{.}\)</span> This implies that <span class="process-math">\(( {a, b} ) \in f\)</span> and hence that <span class="process-math">\(( {b, a} ) \in f^{ - 1}\text{.}\)</span> Thus, each element of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is the first coordinate of an ordered pair in <span class="process-math">\(f^{ - 1}\text{,}\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(f^{ - 1}\)</span> satisfies the first condition of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_functionasordered.html" title="Theorem 6.31">Theorem 6.31</a>.</p>
<p>To prove that <span class="process-math">\(f^{ - 1}\)</span> satisfies the second condition of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_functionasordered.html" title="Theorem 6.31">Theorem 6.31</a>, we must show that each element of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is the first coordinate of exactly one ordered pair in <span class="process-math">\(f^{ - 1}\text{.}\)</span> So let <span class="process-math">\(b \in B\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a_1 , a_2  \in A\)</span> and assume that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/T_functionasordered.html ./knowl/T_functionasordered.html">
\begin{equation*}
( {b, a_1 } ) \in f^{ - 1} \text{ and }  ( {b, a_2 } ) \in f^{ - 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">This means that <span class="process-math">\(( {a_1 , b} ) \in f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(( {a_2 , b} ) \in f\text{.}\)</span> We can then conclude that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/T_functionasordered.html ./knowl/T_functionasordered.html">
\begin{equation*}
f( {a_1 } ) = b\text{ and } f( {a_2 } ) = b\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">But this means that <span class="process-math">\(f( {a_1 } ) = f( {a_2 } )\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a bijection, it is an injection, and we can conclude that <span class="process-math">\(a_1 = a_2\text{.}\)</span> This proves that <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is the first element of only one ordered pair in <span class="process-math">\(f^{ - 1}\text{.}\)</span> Consequently, we have proved that <span class="process-math">\(f^{ - 1}\)</span> satisfies both conditions of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_functionasordered.html" title="Theorem 6.31">Theorem 6.31</a> and hence that <span class="process-math">\(f^{ - 1}\)</span> is a function from <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We now assume that <span class="process-math">\(f^{ - 1}\)</span> is a function from <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and prove that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a bijection. First, to prove that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is an injection, we assume that <span class="process-math">\(a_1 , a_2  \in A\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(f( {a_1 } ) = f( {a_2 } )\text{.}\)</span> We wish to show that <span class="process-math">\(a_1  = a_2\text{.}\)</span> If we let <span class="process-math">\(b = f( {a_1 } ) = f( {a_2 } )\text{,}\)</span> we can conclude that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
( {a_1 , b} ) \in f \text{ and } ( {a_2 , b} ) \in f\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">But this means that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
( {b, a_1 } ) \in f^{ - 1} \text{ and } ( {b, a_2 } ) \in f^{ - 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since we have assumed that <span class="process-math">\(f^{ - 1}\)</span> is a function, we can conclude that <span class="process-math">\(a_1 = a_2\text{.}\)</span> Hence, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is an injection.</p>
<p>Now to prove that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a surjection, we choose <span class="process-math">\(b \in B\)</span> and will show that there exists an <span class="process-math">\(a \in A\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f( a ) = b\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(f^{ - 1}\)</span> is a function, <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> must be the first coordinate of some ordered pair in <span class="process-math">\(f^{ - 1}\text{.}\)</span> Consequently, there exists an <span class="process-math">\(a \in A\)</span> such that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
( {b, a} ) \in f^{ - 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Now this implies that <span class="process-math">\(( {a, b} ) \in f\)</span> and hence that <span class="process-math">\(f( a ) = b\text{.}\)</span> This proves that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a surjection. Since we have also proved that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is an injection, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a bijection.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_inversefunctions.html#T_inverseandbijection" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
