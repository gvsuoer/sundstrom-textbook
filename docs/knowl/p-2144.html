<p>This assertion became known as <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">Fermat's Last Theorem</dfn> but it more properly should have been called Fermat's Last Conjecture. Despite the efforts of mathematicians, this “theorem” remained unproved until Andrew Wiles, a British mathematician, first announced a proof in June of 1993. However, it was soon recognized that this proof had a serious gap, but a widely accepted version of the proof was published by Wiles in 1995. Wiles' proof uses many concepts and techniques that were unknown at the time of Fermat. We cannot discuss the proof here, but we will explore and prove the following proposition, which is a (very) special case of Fermat's Last Theorem. <article class="assemblage assemblage-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Proposition.</span></h5>
<p>There do not exist prime numbers <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(c\)</span> such that  <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(a^3 + b^3 = c^3\text{.}\)</span></p></article> Although Fermat's Last Theorem implies this proposition is true, we will use a proof by contradiction to prove this proposition. For a proof by contradiction, we assume that <blockquote class="blockquote">there exist prime numbers <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(c\)</span> such that <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(a^3 + b^3 = c^3\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> Since 2 is the only even prime number, we will use the following cases: (1) <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(a = b = 2\text{;}\)</span> (2) <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are both odd; and (3) one of <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is odd and the other one is 2.</p>
