<p>This also is very important. We cannot start from square one every time we explore a statement. We must make use of our acquired mathematical knowledge. For the conjecture that <span class="process-math">\(\sin\left(2x \right) = 2 \sin (x)\text{,}\)</span> for all real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> we might recall that there are trigonometric identities called “double angle identities.” We may even remember the correct identity for <span class="process-math">\(\sin\left( 2x \right)\text{,}\)</span> but if we do not, we can always look it up. We should recall (or find) that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\text{ for all real numbers }  x, \sin \! \left( 2x \right) = 2  \sin (x) \!  \cos (x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">We could use this identity to argue that the conjecture “for all real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\sin (2x) = 2 \sin(x)\)</span>” is false, but if we do, it is still a good idea to give a specific counterexample as we did before.</p>
