<p>Since <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}^+\)</span> is countable, it seems reasonable to expect that <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is countable. We will explore this soon. On the other hand, at this point, it may also seem reasonable to ask, “Are there any uncountable sets?” The answer to this question is yes, but we will wait until the next section to prove that certain sets are uncountable. We still have a few more issues to deal with concerning countable sets.</p>
