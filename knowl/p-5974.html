<p>In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/sec94_comment1.html" title="Item 1">Comment 1</a>, we indicated that <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} )\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> have the same cardinality. Combining this with the notation in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/sec94_comment3.html" title="Item 3">Comment 3</a>, this means that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/sec94_comment1.html ./knowl/sec94_comment3.html">
\begin{equation*}
\alpha_1 = \boldsymbol{c}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">However, this does not necessarily mean that <span class="process-math">\(\boldsymbol{c}\)</span> is the “next largest” cardinal number after <span class="process-math">\(\aleph_0\text{.}\)</span> A reasonable question is, “Is there an infinite set with cardinality between <span class="process-math">\(\aleph_0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\boldsymbol{c}\text{?}\)</span>” Rewording this in terms of the real number line, the question is, “On the real number line, is there an infinite set of points that is not equivalent to the entire line and also not equivalent to the set of natural numbers?” This question was asked by Cantor, but he was unable to find any such set. He conjectured that no such set exists. That is, he conjectured that <span class="process-math">\(\boldsymbol{c}\)</span> is really the next cardinal number after <span class="process-math">\(\aleph_0\text{.}\)</span> This conjecture has come to be known as the <dfn class="terminology">Continuum Hypothesis</dfn>. Stated somewhat more formally, the Continuum Hypothesis is <blockquote class="blockquote">There is no set <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(\aleph_0 \lt  \text{ card}  ( X ) 
\lt  \boldsymbol{c}\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> The question of whether the Continuum Hypothesis is true or false is one of the most famous problems in modern mathematics.</p>
