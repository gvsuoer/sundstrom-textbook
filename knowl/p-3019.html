<p>This question seems difficult to answer since how do we prove that a set is empty? This is an instance where proving the contrapositive or using a proof by contradiction could be reasonable approaches. To illustrate these methods, let us assume the proposition we are trying to prove is of the following form: <blockquote class="blockquote">If <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(T = \emptyset\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> If we choose to prove the contrapositive or use a proof by contradiction, we will assume that <span class="process-math">\(T \ne \emptyset\text{.}\)</span> These methods can be outlined as follows:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The contrapositive of “If <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(T = \emptyset\)</span>” is, “If <span class="process-math">\(T \ne \emptyset\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\mynot P\text{.}\)</span>” So in this case, we would assume <span class="process-math">\(T \ne \emptyset\)</span> and try to prove <span class="process-math">\(\mynot P\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Using a proof by contradiction, we would assume <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and assume that <span class="process-math">\(T \ne \emptyset\text{.}\)</span> From these two assumptions, we would attempt to derive a contradiction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">One advantage of these methods is that when we assume that <span class="process-math">\(T \ne \emptyset\text{,}\)</span> then we know that there exists an element in the set <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> We can then use that element in the rest of the proof. We will prove one of the conditional statements for <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/P_subsetprop.html" title="Proposition 5.20">Proposition 5.20</a> by proving its contrapositive. The proof of the other conditional statement associated with <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/P_subsetprop.html" title="Proposition 5.20">Proposition 5.20</a> is <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exer_subsetprop.html" title="Exercise 10">Exercise 10</a>.</p>
