<div class="introduction">
<p>In this section, we focused on the properties of a relation that are part of the definition of an equivalence relation. However, there are other properties of relations that are of importance. We will study two of these properties in this activity.</p>
<p>A relation <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> on a set <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a <dfn class="terminology">circular relation</dfn> provided that for all <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y \mathrel{R} z\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(z \mathrel{R} x\text{.}\)</span></p>
