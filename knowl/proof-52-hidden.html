<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
M = p_1 p_2  \cdots p_m  + 1\text{.}\tag{8.10}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p>Notice that \(M \ne 1\text{.}\) So \(M\) is either a prime number or, by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, \(M\) is a product of prime numbers. In either case, \(M\) has a factor that is a prime number. Since we have listed all the prime numbers, this means that there exists a natural number \(j\) with \(1 \leq j \leq m\) such that \(p_j \mid  M\text{.}\) Now, we can rewrite <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_infiniteprimes1.html" title="Equation 8.10">equation (8.10)</a> as follows:</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
1 = M - p_1 p_2  \cdots p_m\text{.}\tag{8.11}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We have proved \(p_j \mid M\text{,}\) and since \(p_j\) is one of the prime factors of \(p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m\text{,}\) we can also conclude that \(p_j \mid \left( {p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m } \right)\text{.}\) Since \(p_j\) divides both of the terms on the right side of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_infiniteprimes2.html" title="Equation 8.11">equation (8.11)</a>, we can use this equation to conclude that \(p_j\) divides 1. This is a contradiction since a prime number is greater than 1 and cannot divide 1. Hence, our assumption that there are only finitely many primes is false, and so there must be infinitely many primes.</p></article></body>
