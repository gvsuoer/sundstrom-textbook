<p> It is very important to realize that we have only constructed an outline of a proof. Mathematical proofs are not written in table form. They are written in narrative form using complete sentences and correct paragraph structure, and they follow certain conventions used in writing mathematics. In addition, most proofs are written only from the forward perspective. That is, although the use of the backward process was essential in discovering the proof, when we write the proof in narrative form, we use the forward process described in the preceding table. A completed proof follows.</p>
