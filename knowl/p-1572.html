<p> Another method of proof that is frequently used in mathematics is a <dfn class="terminology">proof by contradiction.</dfn> This method is based on the fact that a statement <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> can only be true or false (and not both). The idea is to prove that the statement <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is true by showing that it cannot be false. This is done by assuming that <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is false and proving that this leads to a contradiction. (The contradiction often has the form <span class="process-math">\(\left( {R \wedge \mynot R} \right)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is some statement.) When this happens, we can conclude that the assumption that the statement <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is false is incorrect and hence <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> cannot be false. Since it cannot be false, then <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> must be true.</p>
