<p>Player Two has a winning strategy. On the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>th turn, whatever symbol Player One puts in the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>th position of the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>th row, Player Two must put the other symbol in the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>th position of his or her row. This guarantees that the row of symbols produced by Player Two will be different than any of the rows produced by Player One.</p>
<p>This is the same idea used in Cantor's Diagonal Argument. Once we have a “list” of real numbers in normalized form, we create a real number that is not in the list by making sure that its <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>th decimal place is different than the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>th decimal place for the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>th number in the list. The one complication is that we must make sure that our new real number does not have a decimal expression that ends in all 9's. This was done by using only 3's and 5's.</p>
