<p>The Grand Valley State University Libraries strive to ensure our tools, devices, services, and environments are available to and usable by as many people as possible.</p>
<p>The web version of <span class="booktitle">Mathematical Reasoning: Writing and Proof (PreTeXt Edition)</span> incorporates the following features to support accessibility:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>All content can be navigated by use of a keyboard</p></li>
<li><p>Links, headings, and tables have been designed to work with screen readers</p></li>
<li><p>Many figures and images are described in alt text. Note that some figures are explained fully in the corresponding text.</p></li>
<li><p>Mathematics in PreTeXt are rendered with MathJax so they can be understood by using screen readers and/or other assistive devices.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We have identified some accessibility issues which were beyond the GVSU Libraries' capacity to address in the course of this adaptation. These present an opportunity for future adaptation or revision by educators with expertise in mathematics pedagogy. Known accessibility issues include:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Some exercises and activities in this text require students to visually interpret diagrams or figures; for example, Venn Diagrams (<a href="C_settheory.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: Set Theory">Chapter 5</a>), arrow diagrams (<a href="C_functions.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 6: Functions">Chapter 6</a>), and digraphs (<a href="C_equivrelations.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 7: Equivalence Relations">Chapter 7</a>)These activities cannot be made accessible through alt text alone, and may need to be redesigned or replaced.</p></li>
<li><p>Some images in this text have alt text which may be insufficient to communicate the relevant concepts. The existing alt text would benefit greatly from expert review.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We are always looking for how we can make our resources more accessible. If you are having problems accessing this resource, please contact us at <a href="mailto:oer@gvsu.edu">oer@gvsu.edu</a> to let us know.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="fm_pub_note.html#paragraphs-3" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
