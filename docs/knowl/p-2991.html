<p>Having proved that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a subset of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> we can now ask if <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is actually equal to <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> The work we did in <a href="S_provingset.html#PA_working2sets" class="internal" title="Beginning Activity: Beginning Activity 1: Working with Two Specific Sets">Beginning Activity 1</a> can help us answer this question. In that activity, we should have found several elements that are in <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> but not in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> For example, the integer 2 is in <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> since 2 is even but <span class="process-math">\(2 \notin S\)</span> since 2 is not a multiple of 6. Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(S \ne T\)</span> and we can also conclude that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a proper subset of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span></p>
