<p>Although one example can be used to prove that a conditional statement is false, in most cases, we cannot use examples to prove that a conditional statement is true. For example, in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prog_condition.html" title="Progress Check 1.5: Explorations with Conditional Statements">Progress Check 1.5</a>, we substituted values for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for the conditional statement “If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a positive real number, then <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + 8x\)</span> is a positive real number.” For every positive real number used for <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> we saw that <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + 8x\)</span> was positive. However, this does not prove the conditional statement to be true because it is impossible to substitute every positive real number for <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> So, although we may believe this statement is true, to be able to conclude it is true, we need to write a mathematical proof. Methods of proof will be discussed in <a href="S_1direct.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.2: Constructing Direct Proofs">Section 1.2</a> and <a href="C_proofs.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics">Chapter 3</a>.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1prop.html#rem-cond-state3" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
