<p>Use a proof by contradiction. So, we assume that there exist nonzero real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is rational, <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is irrational, and <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> is rational. Since the rational numbers are closed under division by nonzero rational numbers, this implies that <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{xy}{x}\)</span> is a rational number. Since <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{xy}{x} = y\text{,}\)</span> we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is a rational number and this contradicts the assumption that <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is irrational.</p>
