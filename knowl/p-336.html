<p> We have not yet filled in the reason for the last step because we do not yet know how we will reach the goal. The idea now is to ask ourselves questions about what we know and what we are trying to prove. We usually start with the conclusion that we are trying to prove by asking a so-called <dfn class="terminology">backward question.</dfn> The basic form of the question is, “Under what conditions can we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true?” How we ask the question is crucial since we must be able to answer it. We should first try to ask and answer the question in an abstract manner and then apply it to the particular form of statement <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span></p>
