<p> The proof given for <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/P_linearequation.html" title="Proposition 3.13">Proposition 3.13</a> is called a <dfn class="terminology">constructive proof.</dfn> This is a technique that is often used to prove a so-called <dfn class="terminology">existence theorem.</dfn> The objective of an existence theorem is to prove that a certain mathematical object exists. That is, the goal is usually to prove a statement of the form <blockquote class="blockquote">There exists an <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(P( x )\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> For a constructive proof of such a proposition, we actually name, describe, or explain how to construct some object in the universe that makes <span class="process-math">\(P( x )\)</span> true. This is what we did in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/P_linearequation.html" title="Proposition 3.13">Proposition 3.13</a> since in the proof, we actually proved that <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{c - b}{a}\)</span> is a solution of the equation <span class="process-math">\(ax + b = c\text{.}\)</span> In fact, we proved that this is the only solution of this equation.</p>
