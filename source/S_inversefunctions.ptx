    <p>
      For this section,
      we will use the concept of Cartesian product of two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
      denoted by <m>A \times B</m>,
      which is the set of all ordered pairs <m>(x, y)</m> where <m>x \in A</m> and <m>y \in B</m>.
      That is, <m>A \times B = \left\{ { {\left( {x,y} \right)} \mid x \in A\text{ and } y \in B} \right\}</m>.
      See <xref ref="PA_cartesianproduct"></xref>
      in <xref ref="S_cartesian"></xref>
      for a more thorough discussion of this concept.

      <title>Functions and Sets of Ordered Pairs</title>
      <p>
        When we graph a real function,
        we plot ordered pairs in the Cartesian plane where the first coordinate is the input of the function and the second coordinate is the output of the function.
        For example, if <m>g\x \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}</m>,
        then every point on the graph of <m>g</m> is an ordered pair
        <m>( {x, y} )</m> of real numbers where <m>y = g( x )</m>.
        This shows how we can generate ordered pairs from a function.
        It happens that we can do this with any function.
        For example, let
        <me>
          A = \left\{ {1, 2, 3} \right\} \text{ and }  B = \left\{ {a, b} \right\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Define the function <m>F\x A \to B</m> by
        <me>
          F( 1 ) = a, F( 2 ) = b,  \text{ and } F( 3 ) = b
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can convert each of these to an ordered pair in
        <m>A \times B</m> by using the input as the first coordinate and the output as the second coordinate.
        For example, <m>F( 1 ) = a</m> is converted to <m>( 1, a )</m>,
        <m>F( 2 ) = b</m> is converted to <m>( 2, b )</m>,
        and <m>F( 3 ) = b</m> is converted to <m>( 3, b )</m>.
        So we can think of this function as a set of ordered pairs,
        which is a subset of <m>A \times B</m>, and write
        <me>
          F = \left\{ {( {1, a} ), ( {2, b} ), ( {3, b} )} \right\}\!
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        \note Since <m>F</m> is the name of the function,
        it is customary to use <m>F</m> as the name for the set of ordered pairs.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>A = \left\{ {1, 2, 3} \right\}</m> and let <m>C = \left\{ {a, b, c, d} \right\}</m>.
              Define the function <m>g\x A \to C</m> by <m>g( 1 ) = a</m>,
              <m>g( 2 ) = b</m>, and <m>g( 3 ) = d</m>.
              Write the function <m>g</m> as a set of ordered pairs in <m>A \times C</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        For another example, if we have a real function,
        such as <m>g\x \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}</m> by <m>g( x ) = x^2  - 2</m>,
        then we can think of <m>g</m> as the following infinite subset of <m>\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m>:
        <me>
          g = \left\{ { {( {x, y} ) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}} \mid y = x^2  - 2} \right\}\!
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also write this as <m>g = \left\{ {( {x, x^2 - 2} )} \mid x \in \mathbb{R} \right\}</m>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>f\x \Z \to \Z</m> be defined by
              <m>f(m) = 3m +5</m>, for all <m>m \in \Z</m>.
              Use set builder notation to write the function <m>f</m> as a set of ordered pairs,
              and then use the roster method to write the function <m>f</m> as a set of ordered pairs.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        So any function <m>f\x A \to B</m> can be thought of as a set of ordered pairs that is a subset of <m>A \times B</m>.
        This subset is
        <me>
          f = \left\{ { {( {a, f( a )} ) } \mid a \in A} \right\}  \text{ or } f = \left\{ {( {a, b} ) \in A \times B   \mid b = f( a )} \right\}\!
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand,
        if we started with <m>A = \left\{ {1, 2, 3} \right\}</m>,
        <m>B = \left\{ {a, b} \right\}</m>, and
        <me>
          G = \left\{ {( {1, a} ), ( {2, a} ), ( {3, b} )} \right\} \subseteq A \times B
        </me>,
        then we could think of <m>G</m> as a function from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> with <m>G( 1 ) = a</m>,
        <m>G( 2 ) = a</m>, and <m>G( 3 ) = b</m>.
        The idea is to use the first coordinate of each ordered pair as the input,
        and the second coordinate as the output.
        However, not every subset of
        <m>A \times B</m> can be used to define a function from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>.
        This is explored in the following questions.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>f = \left\{ {( {1, a} ), ( {2, a} ), ( {3, a} ), ( {1, b} )} \right\}</m>.
              Could this set of ordered pairs be used to define a function from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>?

    <title>The Ordered Pair Representation of a Function</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>function</h><h>as set of ordered pairs</h></idx>
      In Beginning  <xref ref="PA_functionasordered"></xref>,
      we observed that if we have a function <m>f\x A \to B</m>,
      we can generate a set of ordered pairs <m>f</m> that is a subset of <m>A \times B</m> as follows:
      <me>
        f = \left\{ { {\left( {a, f( a )} \right)} \mid a \in A} \right\}  \text{ or } f = \left\{ {( {a, b} ) \in A \times B \mid b = f( a )} \right\}\!
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, we also learned that some sets of ordered pairs cannot be used to define a function.
      We now wish to explore under what conditions a set of ordered pairs can be used to define a function.
      Starting with a function <m>f\x  A \to B</m>,
      since <m>\text{ dom } ( f ) = A</m>, we know that
      <men xml:id="eq_65a">
        \text{ For every }   a \in A, \text{ there exists a }   b \in B  \text{ such that } ( {a, b} ) \in f
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, we use <m>b = f( a )</m>.
      This says that every element of <m>A</m> can be used as an input.
      In addition, to be a function,
      each input can produce only one output.
      In terms of ordered pairs,
      this means that there will never be two ordered pairs <m>( {a, b} )</m> and
      <m>( {a, c} )</m> in the function <m>f</m> where <m>a \in A</m>, <m>b,
      c \in B</m>, and <m>b \ne c</m>.
      We can formulate this as a conditional statement as follows:
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp \text{ For every }  a \in A \text{ and every }  b, c \in B,</mrow>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_65b">\amp \text{ if }  ( {a, b} ) \in f  \text{ and }  ( {a, c} ) \in f, \text{ then }  b = c</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This also means that if we start with a subset <m>f</m> of
      <m>A \times B</m> that satisfies conditions<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_65a"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_65b"/>,
      then we can consider <m>f</m> to be a function from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> by using
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>b = f( a )</m> whenever <m>( {a, b} )</m> is in <m>f</m>.
      This proves the following theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_functionasordered">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be nonempty sets and let <m>f</m> be a subset of
          <m>A \times B</m> that satisfies the following two properties:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                For every <m>a \in A</m>,
                there exists <m>b \in B</m> such that <m>( {a, b} ) \in f</m>; and
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                For every <m>a \in A</m> and every <m>b, c \in B</m>,

                then <m>b = c</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          If we use <m>f( a ) = b</m> whenever <m>( {a, b} ) \in f</m>,
          then <m>f</m> is a function from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>.

      <em>A Note about <xref ref="T_functionasordered">Theorem</xref></em>.
      The first condition in <xref ref="T_functionasordered">Theorem</xref>
      means that every element of <m>A</m> is an input,
      and the second condition ensures that every input has exactly one output.
      Many texts will use <xref ref="T_functionasordered">Theorem</xref>
      as the definition of a function.
      Many mathematicians believe that this ordered pair representation of a function is the most rigorous definition of a function.
      It allows us to use set theory to work with and compare functions.
      For example,
      equality of functions becomes a question of equality of sets.
      Therefore, many textbooks will use the ordered pair representation of a function as the definition of a function.

  <subsection>
    <title>The Inverse of a Function</title>
    <p>
      In previous mathematics courses,
      we learned that the exponential function
      (with base <m>e</m>)
      and the natural logarithm function are inverses of each other.
      This was often expressed as follows:
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp \text{ For each }  x \in \R \text{ with }  x > 0 \text{ and for each }  y \in \R,</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp y = \ln x \text{ if and only if }  x = e^y</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that this means that <m>x</m> is the input and <m>y</m> is the output for the natural logarithm function if and only if <m>y</m> is the input and <m>x</m> is the output for the exponential function.
      In essence, the inverse function
      (in this case, the exponential function)
      reverses the action of the original function
      (in this case, the natural logarithm function).
      In terms of ordered pairs (input-output pairs),
      this means that if <m>( {x, y} )</m> is an ordered pair for a function,
      then <m>( {y, x} )</m> is an ordered pair for its inverse.
      This idea of reversing the roles of the first and second coordinates is the basis for our definition of the inverse of a function.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="inversefunction">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f\x A \to B</m> be a function.

              <idx><h>function</h><h>inverse of</h></idx> <m>\boldsymbol{f}</m>, denoted by <m>f^{ - 1}</m>, is the set of ordered pairs <m>\left\{ { {( {b, a} ) \in B \times A} \mid f( a ) = b} \right\}</m>.
          That is,
          <me>
            f^{ - 1}  = \left\{ { {( {b, a} ) \in B \times A} \mid f( a ) = b} \right\}\!
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we use the ordered pair representation for <m>f</m>,
          we could also write
          <me>
            f^{ - 1}  = \left\{ { {( {b, a} ) \in B \times A} \mid ( {a, b} ) \in f} \right\}\!
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Notice that this definition does not state that <m>f^{ - 1}</m> is a function.
      It is simply a subset of <m>B \times A</m>.
      After we study the material in <xref ref="C_equivrelations"></xref>,
      we will say that this means that
      <m>f^{ - 1}</m> is a <em>relation</em>
      from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m>.
      This fact, however, is not important to us now.
      We are mainly interested in the following question:
    </p>
    <p>
      {<em>Under what conditions will the inverse of the function
      <m>\boldsymbol{f\x A \to B}</m> be a function from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m>?</em>}

            Make a conjecture about what conditions on a function

    <p>
      We will now consider a general argument suggested by the explorations in <xref ref="prog_exploringinverse"></xref>.
      By definition, if <m>f\x A \to B</m> is a function,
      then <m>f^{ - 1}</m> is a subset of <m>B \times A</m>.
      However, <m>f^{ - 1}</m> may or may not be a function from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m>.
      For example, suppose that <m>s,
      t \in A</m> with <m>s \ne t</m> and <m>f( s ) = f( t )</m>.
      This is represented in <xref ref="fig_inversenotfunction">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_inversenotfunction">
      <caption>The Inverse Is Not a Function</caption>
      <image width="73%" source="images/figps-noinverse.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In this case, if we try to reverse the arrows,
      we will not get a function from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m>.
      This is because <m>( {y, s} ) \in f^{ - 1}</m> and <m>( {y, t} ) \in f^{ - 1}</m> with <m>s \ne t</m>.
      Consequently, <m>f^{ - 1}</m> is not a function.
      This suggests that when <m>f</m> is not an injection,
      then <m>f^{ - 1}</m> is not a function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, if <m>f</m> is not a surjection,
      then there exists a <m>z \in B</m> such that
      <m>f( a ) \ne z</m> for all <m>a \in A</m>,
      as in the diagram in <xref ref="fig_inversenotfunction">Figure</xref>.
      In other words,
      there is no ordered pair in <m>f</m> with <m>z</m> as the second coordinate.
      This means that there would be no ordered pair in
      <m>f^{ - 1}</m> with <m>z</m> as a first coordinate.
      Consequently,
      <m>f^{ - 1}</m> cannot be a function from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This motivates the statement in <xref ref="T_inverseandbijection">Theorem</xref>.
      In the proof of this theorem,
      we will frequently change back and forth from the input-output representation of a function and the ordered pair representation of a function.
      The idea is that if <m>G\x S \to T</m> is a function,
      then for <m>s \in S</m> and <m>t \in T</m>,
      <me>
        G( s ) = t  \text{ if and only if }   ( {s, t} ) \in G
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we use the ordered pair representation of a function,
      we will also use the ordered pair representation of its inverse.
      In this case, we know that
      <me>
        ( {s, t} ) \in G\text{ if and only if } ( {t, s} ) \in G^{ - 1}
      </me>.

        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be nonempty sets and let <m>f\x A \to B</m>.
          The inverse of <m>f</m> is a function from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m> if and only if <m>f</m> is a bijection.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be nonempty sets and let <m>f\x A \to B</m>.
        We will first assume that <m>f</m> is a bijection and prove that
        <m>f^{ - 1}</m> is a function from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m>.
        To do this, we will show that
        <m>f^{ - 1}</m> satisfies the two conditions of <xref ref="T_functionasordered">Theorem</xref>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We first choose <m>b \in B</m>.
        Since the function <m>f</m> is a surjection,
        there exists an <m>a \in A</m> such that <m>f( a ) = b</m>.
        This implies that <m>( {a, b} ) \in f</m> and hence that <m>( {b, a} ) \in f^{ - 1}</m>.
        Thus, each element of <m>B</m> is the first coordinate of an ordered pair in <m>f^{ - 1}</m>,
        and hence <m>f^{ - 1}</m> satisfies the first condition of <xref ref="T_functionasordered">Theorem</xref>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove that <m>f^{ - 1}</m> satisfies the second condition of <xref ref="T_functionasordered">Theorem</xref>,
        we must show that each element of <m>B</m> is the first coordinate of exactly one ordered pair in <m>f^{ - 1}</m>.
        So let <m>b \in B</m>, <m>a_1 , a_2  \in A</m> and assume that
        <me>
          ( {b, a_1 } ) \in f^{ - 1} \text{ and }  ( {b, a_2 } ) \in f^{ - 1}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that <m>( {a_1 , b} ) \in f</m> and <m>( {a_2 , b} ) \in f</m>.
        We can then conclude that
        <me>
          f( {a_1 } ) = b\text{ and } f( {a_2 } ) = b
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this means that <m>f( {a_1 } ) = f( {a_2 } )</m>.
        Since <m>f</m> is a bijection,
        it is an injection, and we can conclude that <m>a_1 = a_2</m>.
        This proves that <m>b</m> is the first element of only one ordered pair in <m>f^{ - 1}</m>.
        Consequently, we have proved that
        <m>f^{ - 1}</m> satisfies both conditions of <xref ref="T_functionasordered">Theorem</xref>
        and hence that <m>f^{ - 1}</m> is a function from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now assume that <m>f^{ - 1}</m> is a function from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m> and prove that <m>f</m> is a bijection.
        First, to prove that <m>f</m> is an injection,
        we assume that <m>a_1 , a_2  \in A</m> and that <m>f( {a_1 } ) = f( {a_2 } )</m>.
        We wish to show that <m>a_1  = a_2</m>.
        If we let <m>b = f( {a_1 } ) = f( {a_2 } )</m>, we can conclude that
        <me>
          ( {a_1 , b} ) \in f \text{ and } ( {a_2 , b} ) \in f
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this means that
        <me>
          ( {b, a_1 } ) \in f^{ - 1} \text{ and } ( {b, a_2 } ) \in f^{ - 1}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we have assumed that <m>f^{ - 1}</m> is a function,
        we can conclude that <m>a_1 = a_2</m>.
        Hence, <m>f</m> is an injection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now to prove that <m>f</m> is a surjection,
        we choose <m>b \in B</m> and will show that there exists an <m>a \in A</m> such that <m>f( a ) = b</m>.
        Since <m>f^{ - 1}</m> is a function,
        <m>b</m> must be the first coordinate of some ordered pair in <m>f^{ - 1}</m>.
        Consequently, there exists an <m>a \in A</m> such that
        <me>
          ( {b, a} ) \in f^{ - 1}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now this implies that <m>( {a, b} ) \in f</m> and hence that <m>f( a ) = b</m>.
        This proves that <m>f</m> is a surjection.
        Since we have also proved that <m>f</m> is an injection,
        we conclude that <m>f</m> is a bijection.

    <title>Inverse Function Notation</title>
    <p>
      In the situation where <m>f\x A \to B</m> is a bijection and
      <m>f^{ - 1}</m> is a function from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m>,
      we can write <m>f^{ - 1} \x B \to A</m>.
      In this case, we frequently say that <m>f</m> is an
      <em>invertible function</em>,
          <idx><h>invertible function</h></idx>
          <idx><h>function</h><h>invertible</h></idx>
      and we usually do not use the ordered pair representation for either <m>f</m> or <m>f^{ - 1}</m>.
      Instead of writing <m>( {a, b} ) \in f</m>,
      we write <m>f( a ) = b</m>,
      and instead of writing <m>( {b, a} ) \in f^{ - 1}</m>,
      we write <m>f^{ - 1} ( b ) = a</m>.
      Using the fact that <m>( {a, b} ) \in f</m> if and only if <m>( {b, a} ) \in f^{ - 1}</m>,
      we can now write <m>f( a ) = b</m> if and only if <m>f^{ - 1} ( b ) = a</m>.
      We summarize this in <xref ref="T_inversenotation">Theorem</xref>.

      By <xref ref="T_compositefunctions">Theorem</xref>,
      <m>g \circ f\x A \to C</m> is also a bijection.
      Hence, by <xref ref="T_inverseandbijection">Theorem</xref>,

      <m>( {g \circ f} )^{ - 1} \x C \to A</m>.
      Notice that we can also form the composition of <m>g^{ - 1}</m> followed by
      <m>f^{ - 1}</m> to get <m>f^{ - 1} \circ g^{ - 1} \x C \to A</m>.
      <xref ref="fig_bijectioncomposition">Figure</xref>
      helps illustrate the result of the next theorem.

    <theorem xml:id="compositionofbijections">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f\x A \to B</m> and <m>g\x B \to C</m> be bijections.
          Then <m>g \circ f</m> is a bijection and <m>( {g \circ f} )^{ - 1} = f^{ - 1} \circ g^{ - 1}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>f\x A \to B</m> and <m>g\x B \to C</m> be bijections.
        Then <m>f^{ - 1} \x B \to A</m> and <m>g^{ - 1} \x C \to B</m>.
        Hence, <m>f^{ - 1} \circ g^{ - 1} \x C \to A</m>.
        Also, by <xref ref="T_compositefunctions">Theorem</xref>,
        <m>g \circ f\x A \to C</m> is a bijection,
        and hence <m>( {g \circ f} )^{ - 1} \x C \to A</m>.
        We will now prove that for each <m>z \in C</m>,
        <m>( {g \circ f} )^{ - 1} ( z ) = ( {f^{ - 1} \circ g^{ - 1} } )( z )</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>z \in C</m>.
        Since the function <m>g</m> is a surjection,
        there exists a <m>y \in B</m> such that
        <men xml:id="eq_compofbij1">
          g( y ) = z
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, since <m>f</m> is a surjection,
        there exists an <m>x \in A</m> such that
        <men xml:id="eq_compofbij2">
          f( x ) = y
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now these two equations can be written in terms of the respective inverse functions as
        <md>
          <mrow xml:id="eq_compofbij3">g^{ - 1} ( z ) \amp = y; \text{ and }</mrow>
          <mrow xml:id="eq_compofbij4">f^{ - 1} ( y ) \amp = x</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using equations<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_compofbij3"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_compofbij4"/>, we see that
        <md>
          <mrow>\left( {f^{ - 1}  \circ g^{ - 1} } \right)( z ) \amp = f^{ - 1} \left( {g^{ - 1} ( z )} \right)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = f^{ - 1} ( y )</mrow>
          <mrow xml:id="eq_compofbij5">\amp = x</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using equations<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_compofbij1"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_compofbij2"/> again,
        we see that <m>( {g \circ f} )( x ) = z</m>.
        However, in terms of the inverse function, this means that
        <men xml:id="eq_compofbij6">
          ( {g \circ f} )^{ - 1} ( z ) = x
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comparing equations<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_compofbij5"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_compofbij6"/>, we have shown that for all <m>z \in C</m>,
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>( {g \circ f} )^{ - 1} ( z ) = ( {f^{ - 1} \circ g^{ - 1} } )( z )</m>.
        This proves that <m>( {g \circ f} )^{ - 1} = f^{ - 1} \circ g^{ - 1}</m>.

                Since the cube root function and the cubing function are inverses of each other,

                Is it possible to write a formula for
                <m>g^{-1}(y)</m>, where <m>y \in R_5</m>?
                The answer to this question depends on whether or not it is possible to define a cube root of elements of <m>R_5</m>.
                Recall that for a real number <m>x</m>,
                we define the cube root of <m>x</m> to be the real number <m>y</m> such that <m>y^3 = x</m>.
                That is, <m>y = \sqrt[3]{x}</m> if and only if <m>y^3 = x</m>.
                Using this idea,
                is it possible to define the cube root of each number in <m>R_5</m>?
                If so, what are <m>\sqrt[3]{0}</m>, <m>\sqrt[3]{1}</m>,
                <m>\sqrt[3]{2}</m>, <m>\sqrt[3]{3}</m>, and <m>\sqrt[3]{4}</m>?

          <em>Constructing an Inverse Function</em>.
          If <m>f\x A \to B</m> is a bijection,
          then we know that its inverse is a function.
          If we are given a formula for the function <m>f</m>,
          it may be desirable to determine a formula for the function <m>f^{ - 1}</m>.
          This can sometimes be done,
          while at other times it is very difficult or even impossible.
          Let <m>f\x \R \to \R</m> be defined by <m>f( x ) = 2x^3 - 7</m>.
          A graph of this function would suggest that this function is a bijection.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Prove that the function <m>f</m> is an injection and a surjection.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        Let <m>y \in \R</m>.
        One way to prove that <m>f</m> is a surjection is to set
        <m>y = f( x )</m> and solve for <m>x</m>.
        If this can be done, then we would know that there exists an
        <m>x \in \R</m> such that <m>f(x) = y</m>.
        For the function <m>f</m>,
        we are using <m>x</m> for the input and <m>y</m> for the output.
        By solving for <m>x</m> in terms of <m>y</m>,
        we are attempting to write a formula where <m>y</m> is the input and <m>x</m> is the output.
        This formula represents the inverse function.

          <li xml:id="A_constructinverse2">

              Solve the equation <m>y = 2x^3 - 7</m> for <m>x</m>.
              Use this to write a formula for <m>f^{ - 1} ( y )</m>,
              where <m>f^{ - 1} \x \R \to \R</m>.

          <em>The Inverse Sine Function</em>.
          We have seen that in order to obtain an inverse function,
          it is sometimes necessary to restrict the domain
          (or the codomain)
          of a function.
          <ol>
            <li xml:id="A_inversesine1">
              <p>
                Let <m>f\x \R \to \R</m> be defined by <m>f( x ) = \sin x</m>.
                Explain why the inverse of the function <m>f</m> is not a function. (A graph may be helpful.)

            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        Notice that if we use the ordered pair representation, then the sine function can be represented as
        <me>
          f  = \left\{ { {( {x, y} ) \in \R \times \R } \mid y = \sin x} \right\}\!
        </me>.
        If we denote the inverse of the sine function by  <m>\sin ^{ - 1}</m>, then
        <me>
          f^{ - 1}  = \left\{ { {( {y, x} ) \in \R \times \R } \mid y = \sin x} \right\}\!
        </me>.
        Part<nbsp/><xref ref="A_inversesine1"/> proves that  <m>f^{ - 1}</m>  is not a function.  However, in previous mathematics courses, we frequently used the
        <q>inverse sine function.</q>
        This is not really the inverse of the sine function as defined in Part<nbsp/><xref ref="A_inversesine1"/> but, rather, it is the inverse of the sine function <em>restricted to the domain</em> <m>\left[ {-\dfrac{{\pi }}{2}, \dfrac{\pi }{2}} \right]</m>.
        <ol>
          <li xml:id="A_inversesine2">

              Explain why the function <m>F\x \left[ {- \dfrac{{\pi }}{2}, \dfrac{\pi }{2}} \right] \to \left[ { - 1, 1} \right]</m> defined by <m>F( x ) = \sin x</m> is a bijection.

          </li>

        The inverse of the function in Part<nbsp/><xref ref="A_inversesine2"/> is itself a function and is called the <em>inverse sine function</em>

              What is the domain of the inverse sine function?

          </li>
        </ol>
        Let us now use  <m>F ( x ) = \text{ Sin }  ( x )</m> to represent the restricted sine function in Part<nbsp/><xref ref="A_inversesine2"/>.  Therefore, <m>F^{-1} ( x ) = \text{ Sin } ^{ - 1} ( x )</m> can be used to represent the inverse sine function.  Observe that
        <me>
          F\x \left[ -{\frac{{\pi }}{2}, \frac{\pi }{2}} \right] \to \left[ { - 1, 1} \right] \text{ and } F^{ - 1} \x \left[ { - 1, 1} \right] \to \left[ -{\frac{{\pi }}{2}, \frac{\pi } {2}} \right]

              Using this notation, explain why

                \item <m>\text{ Sin } ^{ - 1} y = x \text{ if and only if } \left[ {y = \sin x\text{ and } -\dfrac{{\pi }}{2} \leq x \leq \dfrac{\pi } {2}} \right]</m>; \item <m>\text{ Sin } \!\left( \text{ Sin } ^{-1} ( y ) \right) = y</m> for all <m>y \in \left[ -1, 1 \right]</m>; and \item <m>\text{ Sin } ^{-1} \!\left( \text{ Sin } ( x ) \right) = x</m> for all <m>x \in \left[ - \dfrac{\pi}{2}, \dfrac{\pi}{2} \right]</m>.
