<p>Recognizing that actively studying a mathematics book is often not easy, several features of the textbook have been designed to help you become more engaged as you study the material. Some of the features are:</p>
<dl class="description-list">
<dt>Beginning Activities</dt>
<dd><p>With the exception of <a href="S_reviewproofs.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.6: Review of Proof Methods">Section 3.6</a>, each section has exactly two beginning activities. Some of these activities will review prior mathematical work that is necessary for the new section. This prior work may contain material from previous mathematical courses or it may contain material covered earlier in this text. Other beginning activities will introduce new concepts and definitions that will be used when that section is discussed in class. It is very important that you work on these beginning activities before starting the rest of the section. Please note that answers to these beginning activities are not included in the text. This book is designed to be used for a course and it is left up to the discretion of each individual instructor as to how to distribute the answers to the beginning activities.</p></dd>
<dt>Progress Checks</dt>
<dd><p>Several Progress Checks are included in each section. These are either short exercises or short activities designed to help you determine if you are understanding the material as you are studying the material in the section. As such, it is important to work through these progress checks to test your understanding, and if necessary, study the material again before proceeding further. So it is important to attempt these progress checks before checking the answers, which are provided in <a href="prog-answers.html" class="internal" title="Appendix B: Answers for the Progress Checks">Appendix B</a>.</p></dd>
<dt>Chapter Summaries</dt>
<dd><p>To assist you with studying the material in the text, there is a summary at the end of each chapter. The summaries usually list the important definitions introduced in the chapter and the important results proven in the chapter. If appropriate, the summary also describes the important proof techniques discussed in the chapter.</p></dd>
<dt>Answers for Selected Exercises</dt>
<dd><p>Answers or hints for several exercises are included in an <a href="exer-answers.html" class="internal" title="Appendix C: Answers and Hints for Selected Exercises">Appendix C</a>. In the web version, the answer or hint appears below the exercise. In print and pdf, those exercises with an answer or a hint in the appendix are preceded by an [a] or [h]. The main change in Version 2.0 of this textbook from the previous versions is the addition of more exercises with answers or hints in the appendix.</p></dd>
