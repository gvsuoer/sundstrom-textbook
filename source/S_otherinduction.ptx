    <title>The Domino Theory</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>domino theory</h></idx>
      Mathematical induction is frequently used to prove statements of the form
      <men xml:id="eq_5f">
        \left( {\forall n \in \mathbb{N}} \right)\left( {P( n )} \right)
      </men>,
      where <m>P( n )</m> is an open sentence.
      This means that we are proving that every statement in the following infinite list is true.
      <men xml:id="eq_5g">
        P( 1 ),P( 2 ),P( 3 ), \ldots
      </men>
    </p>
    <p>
      The inductive step in a proof by induction is to prove that if one statement in this infinite list of statements is true,
      then the next statement in the list must be true.
      Now imagine that each statement in<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_5g"/> is a domino in a chain of dominoes.
      When we prove the inductive step,
      we are proving that if one domino is knocked over,
      then it will knock over the next one in the chain.
      Even if the dominoes are set up so that when one falls,
      the next one will fall,
      no dominoes will fall unless we start by knocking one over.
      This is why we need the basis step in an induction proof.
      The basis step guarantees that we knock over the first domino.
      The inductive step, then,
      guarantees that all dominoes after the first one will also fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now think about what would happen if instead of knocking over the first domino,
      we knock over the sixth domino.
      If we also prove the inductive step,
      then we would know that every domino after the sixth domino would also fall.
      This is the idea of the <em>Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction</em>.
      It is not necessary for the basis step to be the proof that <m>P( 1 )</m> is true.
      We can make the basis step be the proof that <m>P( M )</m> is true,
      where <m>M</m> is some natural number.
      The Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction can be generalized somewhat by allowing <m>M</m> to be any integer.
      We are still only concerned with those integers that are greater than or equal to <m>M</m>.

      Let <m>M</m> be an integer.
      If <m>T</m> is a subset of <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> such that
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>M \in T</m>, and

          </p>

      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      then <m>T</m> contains all integers greater than or equal to <m>M</m>.
      That is, <m>\left\{ n \in \mathbb{Z} \mid n \geq M \right\} \subseteq T</m>.
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Using the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction</title>
    <p>
      The primary use of the Principle of Mathematical Induction is to prove statements of the form
      <me>
        \left( {\forall n \in \mathbb{Z},\text{ with }  n \geq M} \right)\left( {P( n )} \right)\!
      </me>,
      where <m>M</m> is an integer and <m>P( n )</m> is some open sentence.
      (In most induction proofs,
      we will use a value of <m>M</m> that is greater than or equal to zero.)
      So our goal is to prove that the truth set <m>T</m> of the predicate <m>P( n )</m> contains all integers greater than or equal to <m>M</m>.
      So to verify the hypothesis of the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction, we must
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prove that <m>M \in T</m>.
            That is, prove that <m>P( M )</m> is true.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prove that for every <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m> with <m>k \geq M</m>,
            if <m>k \in T</m>, then <m>\left( {k + 1} \right) \in T</m>.
            That is, prove that if <m>P( k )</m> is true,
            then <m>P( {k + 1} )</m> is true.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      As before, the first step is called the <em>basis step</em>
          <idx><h>basis step</h></idx>
          <idx><h>mathematical induction</h><h>basis step</h></idx>
      or the <em>initial step</em>,
      and the second step is called the
      <em>inductive step</em>.
          <idx><h>inductive step</h></idx>
          <idx><h>mathematical induction</h><h>inductive step</h></idx>
      This means that a proof using the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction will have the following form: <em>Using the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>M</m> be an integer.
      To prove: <m>\left( {\forall n \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ with } n \geq M} \right)\left( {P( n )} \right)</m>

      </row>
    </tabular>
    <p>
      We can then conclude that <m>P( n )</m> is true for all
      <m>n \in \mathbb{Z}</m> with <m>n \geq M</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is basically the same procedure as the one for using the Principle of Mathematical Induction.
      The only difference is that the basis step uses an integer <m>M</m> other than 1.
      For this reason,
      when we write a proof that uses the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction,
      we often simply say we are going to use a proof by mathematical induction.
      We will use the work from <xref ref="PA_factorials"></xref> to illustrate such a proof.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="P_factorialinduction">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For each natural number <m>n</m> with <m>n \geq 4</m>,
          <m>n! > 2^n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will use a proof by mathematical induction.
        For this proof, we let <m>P( n )</m> be
        <q><m>n! > 2^n</m>.</q>
        We first prove that <m>P( 4 )</m> is true.
        Using <m>n = 4</m>, we see that <m>4! = 24</m> and <m>2^4 = 16</m>.
        This means that <m>4! > 2^4</m> and, hence,
        <m>P\left( 4 \right)</m> is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the inductive step, we prove that for all
        <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m> with <m>k \geq 4</m>,
        if <m>P( k )</m> is true, then <m>P( k + 1 )</m> is true.
        So let <m>k</m> be a natural number greater than or equal to 4, and assume that <m>P( k )</m> is true.
        That is, assume that
        <men xml:id="eq_5h">
          k! > 2^k
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is to prove that <m>P( {k + 1} )</m> is true or that <m>\left( {k + 1} \right)! > 2^{k + 1}</m>.
        Multiplying both sides of inequality<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_5h"/> by <m>k + 1</m> gives
        <md>
          <mrow>\left( k + 1 \right) \cdot k! \amp > \left( k + 1 \right) \cdot 2^k ,\text{  or }</mrow>
          <mrow xml:id="eq_5i">\left( k + 1 \right)! \amp > \left( k + 1 \right) \cdot 2^k </mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, <m>k \geq 4</m>.
        Thus, <m>k + 1 > 2</m>,
        and hence <m>\left( k + 1 \right) \cdot 2^k > 2 \cdot 2^k</m>.
        This means that
        <men xml:id="eq_5j">
          \left( k + 1 \right) \cdot 2^k > 2^{k + 1}
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inequalities<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_5i"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_5j"/> show that
        <me>
          (k + 1)! > 2^{k + 1}
        </me>,
        and this proves that if <m>P(k)</m> is true,
        then <m>P( {k + 1} )</m> is true.
        Thus, the inductive step has been established,
        and so by the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction,
        <m>n! > 2^n</m> for each natural number <m>n</m> with <m>n \geq 4</m>.

    <title>The Second Principle of Mathematical Induction</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>P( n )</m> be <m>n</m> is a prime number or <m>n</m> is a product of prime numbers.
      (This is related to the work in <xref ref="PA_primefactors"></xref>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we would like to use induction to prove that <m>P( n )</m> is true for all natural numbers greater than 1.
      We have seen that the idea of the inductive step in a proof by induction is to prove that if one statement in an infinite list of statements is true,
      then the next statement must also be true.
      The problem here is that when we factor a composite number,
      we do not get to the previous case.
      For example,
      if assume that <m>P(39)</m> is true and we want to prove that <m>P(40)</m> is true,
      we could factor 40 as <m>40 = 2 \cdot 20</m>.
      However, the assumption that <m>P(39)</m> is true does not help us prove that <m>P(40)</m> is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work is intended to show the need for another principle of induction.
      In the inductive step of a proof by induction,
      we assume one statement is true and prove the next one is true.
      The idea of this new principle is to assume that <em>all</em>
      of the previous statements are true and use this assumption to prove the next statement is true.
      This is stated formally in terms of subsets of natural numbers in the
      <em>Second Principle of Mathematical Induction</em>.
      Rather than stating this principle in two versions,
      we will state the extended version of the Second Principle.
      In many cases, we will use <m>M = 1</m> or <m>M = 0</m>.

    <title>Using the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction</title>
    <p>
      The primary use of mathematical induction is to prove statements of the form
      <me>
        \left( {\forall n \in \mathbb{Z},\text{ with } n \geq M} \right)\left( {P( n )} \right)
      </me>,
      where <m>M</m> is an integer and <m>P( n )</m> is some predicate.
      So our goal is to prove that the truth set <m>T</m> of the predicate <m>P( n )</m> contains all integers greater than or equal to <m>M</m>.
      To use the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction, we must
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prove that <m>M \in T</m>.
            That is, prove that <m>P( M )</m> is true.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prove that for every <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
            if <m>k \geq M</m> and <m>\left\{ {M,M + 1, \ldots ,k} \right\} \subseteq T</m>,
            then <m>\left( {k + 1} \right) \in T</m>.
            That is, prove that if <m>P( M ),P( {M + 1} ), \ldots ,P( k )</m> are true,
            then <m>P( {k + 1} )</m> is true.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      As before, the first step is called the <em>basis step</em>
          <idx><h>basis step</h></idx>
          <idx><h>mathematical induction</h><h>basis step</h></idx>
      or the <em>initial step</em>,
      and the second step is called the
      <em>inductive step</em>.
          <idx><h>inductive step</h></idx>
          <idx><h>mathematical induction</h><h>inductive step</h></idx>
      This means that a proof using the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction will have the following form:

    Let  <m>M</m>  be an integer.  To prove:

    </tabular>
    \vskip10pt
    We can then conclude that  <m>P( n )</m> is true for all  <m>n \in \mathbb{Z}</m> with  <m>n \geq M</m>.
    <p>
      We will use this procedure to prove the proposition suggested in <xref ref="PA_primefactors"></xref>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_primefactors">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Each natural number greater than 1 either is a prime number or is a product of prime numbers.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will use the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction.
        We let <m>P( n )</m> be <m>n</m> is a prime number or <m>n</m> is a product of prime numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the basis step, <m>P ( 2 )</m> is true since 2 is a prime number.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove the inductive step,
        we let <m>k</m> be a natural number with <m>k \geq 2</m>.
        We assume that <m>P( 2 ),P( 3 ), \ldots ,P( k )</m> are true.
        That is, we assume that each of the natural numbers
        <m>2,3, \ldots ,k</m> is a prime number or a product of prime numbers.
        The goal is to prove that <m>P( {k + 1} )</m> is true or that <m>(k + 1)</m> is a prime number or a product of prime numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Case 1</em>: If <m>\left( {k + 1} \right)</m> is a prime number,
        then <m>P( {k + 1} )</m> is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Case 2</em>: If <m>\left( {k + 1} \right)</m> is not a prime number,
        then <m>\left( {k + 1} \right)</m> can be factored into a product of natural numbers with each one being less than <m>\left( {k + 1} \right)</m>.
        That is, there exist natural numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> with
        <me>
          k + 1 = a \cdot b,  \text{ and }   1 \lt  a \leq k \text{ and }   1 \lt  b \leq k
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the inductive assumption,
        this means that <m>P( a )</m> and <m>P( b )</m> are both true.
        Consequently,
        <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are prime numbers or are products of prime numbers.
        Since <m>k + 1 = a \cdot b</m>,
        we conclude that <m>\left( {k + 1} \right)</m> is a product of prime numbers.
        That is, we conclude that <m>P\left( {k + 1} \right)</m> is true.
        This proves the inductive step.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, by the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction,
        we conclude that <m>P( n )</m> is true for all
        <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m> with <m>n \geq 2</m>,
        and this means that each natural number greater than 1 is either a prime number or is a product of prime numbers.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      We will conclude this section with a progress check that is really more of an activity.
      We do this rather than including the activity at the end of the exercises since this activity illustrates a use of the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction in which it is convenient to have the basis step consist of the proof of more than one statement.

    <investigation xml:id="A_lincomb3and5">
      <title>Using the Second Principle of Induction</title>
      <p>
        Consider the following question:
        <ul>
          \item For which natural numbers <m>n</m> do there exist nonnegative integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>n = 3x + 5y</m>?
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        To help answer this question,
        we will let <m>\mathbb{Z}^* = \left\{ {x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \geq 0} \right\}</m>,
        and let <m>P \left( n \right)</m> be There exist
        <m>x,y \in \mathbb{Z}^*</m> such that <m>n = 3x + 5y</m>.
        Notice that <m>P(1)</m> is false since if both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are zero,
        then <m>3x + 5y = 0</m> and if either <m>x > 0</m> or <m>y > 0</m>,
        then <m>3x + 5y \geq 3</m>.
        Also notice that <m>P(6)</m> is true since
        <m>6 = 3 \cdot 2 + 5 \cdot 0</m> and <m>P(8)</m> is true since <m>8 = 3 \cdot 1 + 5 \cdot 1</m>.

            <p>
              Explain why <m>P(2)</m>, <m>P(4)</m>,

          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        We could continue trying to determine other values of <m>n</m> for which <m>P(n)</m> is true.
        However, let us see if we can use the work in part<nbsp/>(2) to determine if <m>P(13)</m> is true.
        Notice that <m>13 = 3 + 10</m> and we know that <m>P(10)</m> is true.
        We should be able to use this to prove that <m>P(13)</m> is true.
        This is formalized in the next part.

              <m>P ( 9 )</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>P( k )</m> are true,

                    We let <m>k</m> be a natural number and assume that <m>2^k > 1 + k</m>.
                    Multiplying both sides of this inequality by 2, we see that <m>2^{k+1} > 2 + 2k</m>.
                    However, <m>2 + 2k > 2 + k</m> and, hence,

                Each natural number greater than or equal to 6 can be written as the sum of natural numbers,
                each of which is a 2 or a 5.
                <proof>
                  <p>
                    We will use a proof by induction.
                    For each natural number <m>n</m>, we let <m>P( n )</m> be,
                    <q>There exist nonnegative integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>n = 2x + 5y</m>.</q>
                    Since
                    <md>
                      <mrow>6 \amp = 3 \cdot 2 + 0 \cdot 5  \amp   7 \amp = 2 + 5</mrow>
                      <mrow>8 \amp = 4 \cdot 2 + 0 \cdot 5  \amp   9 \amp = 2 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 5</mrow>
                    </md>
                    we see that <m>P(6 ), P(7 ), P(8 )</m>,
                    and <m>P( 9 )</m> are true.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We now suppose that for some natural number <m>k</m> with
                    <m>k \geq 10</m> that <m>P(6 ), P (7 ), \ldots, P (k )</m> are true.
                    Now
                    <me>
                      k + 1 = \left(k - 4 \right) + 5
                    </me>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since <m>k \geq 10</m>, we see that <m>k - 4 \geq 6</m> and,
                    hence, <m>P(k - 4 )</m> is true.
                    So <m>k - 4 = 2x + 5y</m> and, hence,
                    <me>
                      \begin{aligned}k + 1 \amp = \left(2x + 5y \right) + 5 \\ \amp = 2x + 5 \left(y + 1 \right)\!. \end{aligned}
                    </me>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This proves that <m>P(k + 1 )</m> is true,
                    and hence, by the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction,
                    we have proved that for each natural number <m>n</m> with <m>n \geq 6</m>,
                    there exist nonnegative integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>n = 2x + 5y</m>.

          <em>De Moivre's Theorem</em>.
            <idx><h>De Moivre's Theorem</h></idx>
        One of the most interesting results in trigonometry is De Moivre's Theorem,
          which relates the complex number <m>i</m> to the trigonometric functions.
          Recall that the number <m>i</m> is a complex number whose square is <m>-1</m>, that is,
          <m>i^2 = -1</m>.
          One version of the theorem can be stated as follows:
          <ul>
            \item If  <m>x</m>  is a real number, then for each nonnegative integer <m>n</m>,
            <me>
              \left[ {\cos x + i(\sin x)} \right]^n  = \cos (nx) + i( {\sin (nx)} )\!
            </me>.
          </ul>
        </p>
        This theorem is named after Abraham de Moivre
            <idx><h>de Moivre, Abraham</h></idx>
        (1667 <mdash/> 1754), a French mathematician.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The proof of De Moivre's Theorem requires the use of the trigonometric identities for the sine and cosine of the sum of two angles.
              Use the Internet or a book to find identities for
              <m>\sin( \alpha + \beta)</m> and <m>\cos (\alpha + \beta)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              To get a sense of how things work,
              expand <m>\left[ {\cos x + i(\sin x)} \right]^2</m> and write the result in the form <m>a + bi</m>.
              Then use the identities from part<nbsp/>(1) to prove that <m>\left[ {\cos x + i(\sin x)} \right]^2 = \cos (2x) + i( {\sin (2x)} )</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Use mathematical induction to prove De Moivre's Theorem.
