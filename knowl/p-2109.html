<p>We know that the conditional statement <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> is automatically true when the hypothesis is false. Therefore, because our goal is to prove that <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> is true, there is nothing to do in the case that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is false. Consequently, we may assume that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true. Then, in order for <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> to be true, the conclusion <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> must also be true. (When <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true, but <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is false, <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> is false.) Thus, we must use our assumption that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true to show that <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is also true.</p>
