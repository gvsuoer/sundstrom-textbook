<p>When a statement is false, it is sometimes possible to add an assumption that will yield a true statement. This is usually done by using a conditional statement. So instead of working with the statement in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/LA_contradiction2-1.html" title="Exercise 3">Exercise 3</a>, we will work with a related statement that is obtained by adding an assumption (or assumptions) to the hypothesis. <blockquote class="blockquote">For each real number <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt x \lt 1\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{1}{x(1 - x)} \geq 4\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> To begin a proof by contradiction for this statement, we need to assume the negation of the statement. To do this, we need to negate the entire statement, including the quantifier. Recall that the negation of a statement with a universal quantifier is a statement that contains an existential quantifier. (See <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_negations.html" title="Theorem 2.24">Theorem 2.24</a>.) With this in mind, carefully write down all assumptions made at the beginning of a proof by contradiction for this statement.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_contradiction.html#exercise-204" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
