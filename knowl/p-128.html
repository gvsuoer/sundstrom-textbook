<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Guesswork and conjectures.</span></span><p>Formulate and write down questions and <dfn class="terminology">conjectures</dfn>. When we make a guess in mathematics, we usually call it a <dfn class="terminology">conjecture</dfn>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Examples.</span></span><p><em class="emphasis">Constructing appropriate examples is extremely important</em>. Exploration often requires looking at lots of examples. In this way, we can gather information that provides evidence that a statement is true, or we might find an example that shows the statement is false. This type of example is called a <dfn class="terminology">counterexample</dfn>.</p>
<p>For example, if someone makes the conjecture that <span class="process-math">\(\sin \! \left(2x \right) = 2 \sin (x)\text{,}\)</span> for all real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> we can test this conjecture by substituting specific values for <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> One way to do this is to choose values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(\sin (x)\)</span> is known. Using <span class="process-math">\(x = \dfrac{\pi}{4}\text{,}\)</span> we see that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}\sin \! \left( 2 \left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right) \right) \amp = \sin 
\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1, \text{ and }  \\ 2 \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \amp = 
2 \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2}. \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since <span class="process-math">\(1 \ne \sqrt{2}\text{,}\)</span> these calculations show that this conjecture is false. However, if we do not find a counterexample for a conjecture, we usually cannot claim the conjecture is true. The best we can say is that our examples indicate the conjecture is true. As an example, consider the conjecture that <blockquote class="blockquote">If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are odd integers, then <span class="process-math">\(x + y\)</span> is an even integer.</blockquote> We can do lots of calculations, such as <span class="process-math">\(3 + 7 = 10\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5 + 11 = 16\text{,}\)</span> and find that every time we add two odd integers, the sum is an even integer. However, it is not possible to test every pair of odd integers, and so we can only say that the conjecture appears to be true. (We will prove that this statement is true in the next section.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Use of prior knowledge.</span></span><p>This also is very important. We cannot start from square one every time we explore a statement. We must make use of our acquired mathematical knowledge. For the conjecture that <span class="process-math">\(\sin\left(2x \right) = 2 \sin (x)\text{,}\)</span> for all real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> we might recall that there are trigonometric identities called “double angle identities.” We may even remember the correct identity for <span class="process-math">\(\sin\left( 2x \right)\text{,}\)</span> but if we do not, we can always look it up. We should recall (or find) that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\text{ for all real numbers }  x, \sin \! \left( 2x \right) = 2  \sin (x) \!  \cos (x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">We could use this identity to argue that the conjecture “for all real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\sin (2x) = 2 \sin(x)\)</span>” is false, but if we do, it is still a good idea to give a specific counterexample as we did before.</p>

<span class="heading"><span class="title">Cooperation and brainstorming.</span></span><p>Working together is often more fruitful than working alone. When we work with someone else, we can compare notes and articulate our ideas. Thinking out loud is often a useful brainstorming method that helps generate new ideas.</p>
