<p>Given an even natural number, is it possible to write it as a sum of two prime numbers? For example,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
4 \amp = 2 + 2  \amp    6 \amp = 3 + 3  \amp   8 \amp = 5+3\\
78 \amp = 37 + 41 \amp   90 \amp = 43 + 47  \amp   138 \amp = 67 + 71
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">One of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics is a conjecture made by Christian Goldbach in a letter to Leonhard Euler in 1742. The conjecture, now known as <dfn class="terminology">Goldbach's Conjecture</dfn>, is as follows: <blockquote class="blockquote">Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two (not necessarily distinct) prime numbers.</blockquote> As of June 25, 2010, it is not known if this conjecture is true or false, although most mathematicians believe it to be true.</p>
