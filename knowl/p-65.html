<p>The first chapter sets the stage for the rest of the book. It introduces students to the use of conditional statements in mathematics, begins instruction in the process of constructing a direct proof of a conditional statement, and introduces many of the writing guidelines that will be used throughout the rest of the book. This is not meant to be a thorough introduction to methods of proof. Before this is done, it is necessary to introduce the students to the parts of logic that are needed to aid in the construction of proofs. This is done in <a href="C_2logic.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: Logical Reasoning">ChapterÂ 2</a>.</p>
