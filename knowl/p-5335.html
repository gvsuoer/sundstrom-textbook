<p>In this section, we will use these results to help prove the so-called Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which states that any natural number greater than 1 that is not prime can be written as product of primes in “essentially” only one way. This means that given two prime factorizations, the prime factors are exactly the same, and the only difference may be in the order in which the prime factors are written. We start with more results concerning greatest common divisors. We first prove <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/P_divlinearcomb.html" title="Proposition 5.22">Proposition 5.22</a>, which was part of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exer52-choose.html" title="Activity 30: Using the Choose-an-Element Method in a Different Setting">Activity 30</a> in <a href="S_provingset.html" class="internal" title="Section 5.2: Proving Set Relationships">Section 5.2</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exer81_lincomb.html" title="Activity 47: Linear Combinations and the Greatest Common Divisor">Activity 47</a> in <a href="S_gcd.html" class="internal" title="Section 8.1: The Greatest Common Divisor">Section 8.1</a>.</p>
