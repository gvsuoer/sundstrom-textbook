<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> be a nonempty set and let <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> be a relation on <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span></p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The relation <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">reflexive on <span class="process-math">\(\boldsymbol{A}\)</span></dfn> provided that for each <span class="process-math">\(x \in A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x \mathrel{R} x\)</span> or, equivalently, <span class="process-math">\(\left( {x, x} \right) \in R\text{.}\)</span> This means that if a reflexive relation is represented on a digraph, there would have to be a loop at each vertex, as is shown in the following figure. <div class="image-box" style="width: 10%; margin-left: 45%; margin-right: 45%;"><img src="external/figps-reflexive.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> </p></li>
<li><p>The relation <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">symmetric</dfn> provided that for every <span class="process-math">\(x,
y \in A\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(x \mathrel{R} y\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span> or, equivalently, for every <span class="process-math">\(x, y \in A\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(\left( {x, y} \right) \in R\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\left( {y, x} \right) \in R\text{.}\)</span> This means that if a symmetric relation is represented on a digraph, then anytime there is a directed edge from one vertex to a second vertex, there would be a directed edge from the second vertex to the first vertex, as is shown in the following figure. <div class="image-box" style="width: 30%; margin-left: 35%; margin-right: 35%;"><img src="external/figps-symmetric.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> </p></li>
<li>
<p>The relation <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">transitive</dfn> provided that for every <span class="process-math">\(x, y, z \in A\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y \mathrel{R} z\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(x \mathrel{R} z\)</span> or, equivalently, for every <span class="process-math">\(x, y, z \in A\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(\left( {x, y} \right) \in R\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\left( {y, z} \right) \in R\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\left( {x, z} \right) \in R\text{.}\)</span> So if a transitive relation is represented by a digraph, then anytime there is a directed edge from a vertex <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to a vertex <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> and a directed edge from <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> to a vertex <span class="process-math">\(z\text{,}\)</span> there would be a directed edge from <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>In addition, if a transitive relation is represented by a digraph, then anytime there is a directed edge from a vertex <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to a vertex <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> and a directed edge from <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> to the vertex <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> there would be loops at <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> These two situations are illustrated as follows: <div class="image-box" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><img src="external/figps-transitive.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> </p>
