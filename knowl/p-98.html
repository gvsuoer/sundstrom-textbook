<p>As we saw in <a href="S_1prop.html#PA_prop" class="internal" title="Beginning Activity: Beginning Activity 1: Statements">Beginning Activity 1</a>, some sentences that are mathematical in nature often are not statements because we may not know precisely what a variable represents. Following are some more examples</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>There exists a real number <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x+7 = 10\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>This is a statement because either such a real number exists or such a real number does not exist. In this case, this is a true statement since such a real number does exist, namely <span class="process-math">\(x = 3\text{.}\)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each real number <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(2x + 5 = 2\left(x + \dfrac{5}{2} \right)\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>This is a statement since either the sentence <span class="process-math">\(2x + 5 = 2\left(x + \dfrac{5}{2} \right)\)</span> is true when any real number is substituted for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> (in which case, the statement is true) or there is at least one real number that can be substituted for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and produce a false statement (in which case, the statement is false). In this case, the given statement is true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solve the equation <span class="process-math">\(x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>This is not a statement since it is a directive. It does not assert that something is true.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2\)</span> is not a statement since it is not known what <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> represent. However, the sentence, “There exist real numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2\)</span>” is a statement. In fact, this is a true statement since there are such integers. For example, if <span class="process-math">\(a = 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b = 0\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Compare the statement in the previous item to the statement, “For all real numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2\text{.}\)</span>” This is a false statement since there are values for <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\((a + b)^2 \ne a^2 + b^2\text{.}\)</span> For example, if <span class="process-math">\(a = 2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b = 3\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\((a + b)^2 = 5^2 = 25\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a^2 + b^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 = 13\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
