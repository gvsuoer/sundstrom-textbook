<p>Instruction on how to write proofs begins in <a href="S_1direct.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.2: Constructing Direct Proofs">Section 1.2</a> and is developed further in <a href="C_proofs.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics">Chapter 3</a>. In addition, <a href="C_induction.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: Mathematical Induction">Chapter 4</a> is devoted to developing students' abilities to construct proofs using mathematical induction. Students are introduced to a method to organize their thought processes when attempting to construct a proof that uses a so-called know-show table. (See <a href="S_1direct.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.2: Constructing Direct Proofs">Section 1.2</a> and <a href="S_directproof.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.1: Direct Proofs">Section 3.1</a>.) Students use this table to work backward from what it is they are trying to prove while at the same time working forward from the assumptions of the problem. The know-show tables are used quite extensively in <a href="C_1intro.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 1: Introduction to Writing Proofs in Mathematics">Chapter 1</a> and <a href="C_proofs.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics">Chapter 3</a>. However, the explicit use of know-show tables is gradually reduced and these tables are rarely used in the later chapters. One reason for this is that these tables may work well when there appears to be only one way of proving a certain result. As the proofs become more complicated or other methods of proof (such as proofs using cases) are used, these know-show tables become less useful.</p>
