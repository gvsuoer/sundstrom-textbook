<p>The statement <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> is either true or false. In a proof by contradiction, we show that it is true by eliminating the only other possibility (that it is false). We show that <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> cannot be false by assuming it is false and reaching a contradiction. Since we assume that <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> is false, and the only way for a conditional statement to be false is for its hypothesis to be true and its conclusion to be false, we assume that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true and that <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is false (or, equivalently, that <span class="process-math">\(\mynot Q\)</span> is true). When we reach a contradiction, we know that our original assumption that <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> is false is incorrect. Hence, <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> cannot be false, and so it must be true.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_reviewproofs.html#li-313" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
