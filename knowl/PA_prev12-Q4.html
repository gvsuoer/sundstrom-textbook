<p>To start a proof of this proposition, we will assume that the hypothesis of the conditional statement is true. So in this case, we assume that both <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are odd integers. We can then use the definition of an odd integer to conclude that there exists and integer <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x = 2m + 1\text{.}\)</span> Now use the definition of an odd integer to make a conclusion about the integer <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Note: The definition of an odd integer says that a certain other integer exists. This definition may be applied to both <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> However, do not use the same letter in both cases. To do so would imply that <span class="process-math">\(x = y\)</span> and we have not made that assumption. To be more specific, if <span class="process-math">\(x = 2m + 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y = 2m + 1\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(x = y\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1direct.html#PA_prev12-Q4" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
