<p>There are many unanswered questions about prime numbers, two of which will now be discussed.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">The Twin Prime Conjecture.</span></span><p>By looking at the list of the first 25 prime numbers, we see several cases where consecutive prime numbers differ by 2. Examples are:  3  and  5;  11 and  13;  17 and  19; 29  and  31. Such pairs of prime numbers are said to be <dfn class="terminology">twin primes</dfn>. How many twin primes exist? The answer is not known. The <dfn class="terminology">Twin Prime Conjecture</dfn> states that there are infinitely many twin primes. As of June 25, 2010, this is still a conjecture as it has not been proved or disproved. For some interesting information on prime numbers, visit the Web site <a class="external" href="http://primes.utm.edu/" target="_blank">The Prime Pages</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-8-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8"><sup> 8 </sup></a> where there is a link to The Largest Known Primes Web site. According to information at this site as of June 25, 2010, the largest known twin primes are</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\left( 65516468355 \times 2^{333333} - 1 \right) \text{ and } \left( 65516468355 \times 2^{333333} + 1 \right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Each of these prime numbers contains 100355 digits.</p>

<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Goldbach's Conjecture.</span></span><p>Given an even natural number, is it possible to write it as a sum of two prime numbers? For example,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
4 \amp = 2 + 2  \amp    6 \amp = 3 + 3  \amp   8 \amp = 5+3\\
78 \amp = 37 + 41 \amp   90 \amp = 43 + 47  \amp   138 \amp = 67 + 71
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">One of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics is a conjecture made by Christian Goldbach in a letter to Leonhard Euler in 1742. The conjecture, now known as <dfn class="terminology">Goldbach's Conjecture</dfn>, is as follows: <blockquote class="blockquote">Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two (not necessarily distinct) prime numbers.</blockquote> As of June 25, 2010, it is not known if this conjecture is true or false, although most mathematicians believe it to be true.</p>
