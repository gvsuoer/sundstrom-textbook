<p>In <a href="S_2predicates.html#PA_sets" class="internal" title="Beginning Activity: Beginning Activity 1: Sets and Set Notation">Beginning Activity 1</a>, we indicated that a set is a well-defined collection of objects that can be thought of as an entity itself. <figure class="list table-like"><figcaption><span class="type">List</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">2.13<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Elements of Sets</figcaption><div class="named-list-content"><ol class="decimal">
<li><p>If <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a set and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is one of the objects in the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> we write <span class="process-math">\(y \in A\)</span> and read this as “<span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is an element of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span>” or “<span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is a member of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>” For example, if <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is the set of all integers greater than 4, then we could write <span class="process-math">\(5 \in B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(10 \in B\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If an object <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> is not an element in the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> we write <span class="process-math">\(z \notin A\)</span> and read this as “<span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> is not an element of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>” For example, if <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is the set of all integers greater than 4, then we could write <span class="process-math">\(-2 \notin B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(4 \notin B\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ol></div></figure> When working with a mathematical object, such as set, we need to define when two of these objects are equal. We are also often interested in whether or not one set is contained in another set.</p>
