<p>It is important to understand the use of the operator “or.” In mathematics, we use the “<dfn class="terminology">inclusive or</dfn>” unless stated otherwise. This means that <span class="process-math">\(P \vee Q\)</span> is true when both <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> are true and also when only one of them is true. That is, <span class="process-math">\(P \vee Q\)</span> is true when at least one of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true, or <span class="process-math">\(P \vee Q\)</span> is false only when both <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> are false.</p>
<p>A different use of the word “or” is the “<dfn class="terminology">exclusive or.</dfn>” For the exclusive or, the resulting statement is false when both statements are true. That is, “<span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> exclusive or <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span>” is true only when exactly one of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true. In everyday life, we often use the exclusive or. When someone says, “At the intersection, turn left or go straight,” this person is using the exclusive or.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="S_2logop.html#paragraphs-8">in-context</a></span>
