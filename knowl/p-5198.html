<p>One of the most important concepts in elementary number theory is that of the greatest common divisor of two integers. The definition for the greatest common divisor of two integers (not both zero) was given in <a href="S_gcd.html#PA_gcd" class="internal" title="Beginning Activity: Beginning Activity 1: The Greatest Common Divisor">Beginning Activity 1</a>.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<p>If <span class="process-math">\(a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are not both 0, and if <span class="process-math">\(d \in \mathbb{N}\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(d = \gcd( {a, b} )\)</span> provided that it satisfies all of the following properties:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(d \mid a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d \mid b\text{.}\)</span> That is, <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is a common divisor of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is a natural number such that <span class="process-math">\(k \mid a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(k \mid b\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(k \leq d\text{.}\)</span> That is, any other common divisor of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is less than or equal to <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consequently, a natural number <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is not the greatest common divisor of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> provided that it does not satisfy at least one of these properties. That is, <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is not equal to <span class="process-math">\(\gcd( {a, b} )\)</span> provided that</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> does not divide <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> does not divide <span class="process-math">\(b\text{;}\)</span> or</p></li>
<li><p>There exists a natural number <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(k \mid a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(k \mid b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(k &gt; d\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>This means that <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is not the greatest common divisor of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> provided that it is not a common divisor of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> or that there exists a common divisor of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> that is greater than <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span></p>
