<p>The relation <span class="process-math">\(\approx\)</span> is reflexive on <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P}\left( U \right)\)</span> since for all <span class="process-math">\(A \in \mathcal{P}\left( U \right)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\card(A) = \card(A)\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>The relation <span class="process-math">\(\approx\)</span> is symmetric since for all <span class="process-math">\(A, B \in \mathcal{P}\left( U \right)\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(\card(A) = \card(B)\text{,}\)</span> then using the fact that equality on <span class="process-math">\(\Z\)</span> is symmetric, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\card(B) = \card(A)\text{.}\)</span> That is, if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> has the same number of elements as <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> has the same number of elements as <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>The relation <span class="process-math">\(\approx\)</span> is transitive since for all <span class="process-math">\(A, B, C \in 
\mathcal{P}\left( U \right)\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(\card(A) = \card(B)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\card(B) = \card(C)\text{,}\)</span> then using the fact that equality on <span class="process-math">\(\Z\)</span> is transitive, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\card(A) = \card(C)\text{.}\)</span> That is, if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> have the same number of elements and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> have the same number of elements, then <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> have the same number of elements.</p>
<p>Therefore, the relation <span class="process-math">\(\approx\)</span> is an equivalence relation on <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P}\left( U \right)\text{.}\)</span></p>
