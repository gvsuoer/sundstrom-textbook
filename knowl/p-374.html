<p>Finally, it is very important to realize that not every proof can be constructed by the use of a simple know-show table. Proofs will get more complicated than the ones that are in this section. The main point of this section is not the know-show table itself, but the way of thinking about a proof that is indicated by a know-show table. In most proofs, it is very important to specify carefully what it is that is being assumed and what it is that we are trying to prove. The process of asking the “backward questions” and the “forward questions” is the important part of the know-show table. It is very important to get into the “habit of mind” of working backward from what it is we are trying to prove and working forward from what it is we are assuming. Instead of immediately trying to write a complete proof, we need to stop, think, and ask questions such as <blockquote class="blockquote">Just exactly what is it that I am trying to prove?</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">How can I prove this?</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">What methods do I have that may allow me to prove this?</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">What are the assumptions?</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">How can I use these assumptions to prove the result?</blockquote></p>
