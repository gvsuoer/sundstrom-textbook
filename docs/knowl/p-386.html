<p>In this section, it was noted that there is often more than one way to answer a backward question. For example, if the backward question is, “How can we prove that two real numbers are equal?”, one possible answer is to prove that their difference equals 0. Another possible answer is to prove that the first is less than or equal to the second and that the second is less than or equal to the first.</p>
