<p>Most of the examples we have studied so far have involved a relation on a small finite set. For these examples, it was convenient to use a directed graph to represent the relation. It is now time to look at some other type of examples, which may prove to be more interesting. In these examples, keep in mind that there is a subtle difference between the reflexive property and the other two properties. The reflexive property states that some ordered pairs actually belong to the relation <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> or some elements of <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(A\)</span> are related. The reflexive property has a universal quantifier and, hence, we must prove that for all <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(x \in A\text{,}\)</span> <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(x \mathrel{R} x\text{.}\)</span> Symmetry and transitivity, on the other hand, are defined by conditional sentences. We often use a direct proof for these properties, and so we start by assuming the hypothesis and then showing that the conclusion must follow from the hypothesis.</p>
