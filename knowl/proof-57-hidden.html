<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Let \(S\) be a finite set and assume that \(A\) is a subset of \(S\text{.}\) If \(A = \emptyset\text{,}\) then \(A\) is a finite set and \(\text{ card} ( A ) \leq \text{ card} ( S )\text{.}\) So we assume that \(A \ne \emptyset\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Since \(S\) is finite, there exists a bijection \(f\x S \to \mathbb{N}_k\) for some \(k \in \mathbb{N}\text{.}\) In this case, \(\text{ card} ( S ) = k\text{.}\) We need to show that \(A\) is equivalent to a finite set. To do this, we define \(g\x A \to f ( A )\) by \(g ( x ) = f ( x )\) for each \(x \in A\text{.}\) Since \(f\) is an injection, we conclude that \(g\) is an injection. Now let \(y \in f ( A )\text{.}\) Then there exists an \(a \in A\) such that \(f ( a ) = y\text{.}\) But by the definition of \(g\text{,}\) this means that \(g ( a ) = y\text{,}\) and hence \(g\) is a surjection. This proves that \(g\) is a bijection.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Hence, we have proved that \(A \approx f ( A )\text{.}\) Since \(f ( A )\) is a subset of \(\mathbb{N}_k\text{,}\) we use <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/L_subsetsofNk.html" title="Lemma 9.1.7">Lemma 9.1.7</a> to conclude that \(f ( A )\) is finite and \(\text{ card} ( f ( A ) ) \leq k\text{.}\) In addition, by <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_equivfinitesets.html" title="Theorem 9.1.5">Theorem 9.1.5</a>, \(A\) is a finite set and \(\text{ card} ( A ) = \text{ card} ( f ( A ) )\text{.}\) This proves that \(A\) is a finite set and \(\text{ card} ( A ) \leq \text{ card} ( S )\text{.}\)</p></article></body>
