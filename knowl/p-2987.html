<p>We overcome this difficulty by using the <dfn class="terminology">choose-an-element method</dfn>, where we choose an arbitrary element with the given property. So in this case, we choose an integer <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> that is a multiple of 6. We cannot use a specific multiple of 6 (such as 12 or 24), but rather the only thing we can assume is that the integer satisfies the property that it is a multiple of 6. This is the key part of this method. <blockquote class="blockquote">Whenever we choose an arbitrary element with a given property, we are not selecting a specific element. Rather, the only thing we can assume about the element is the given property.</blockquote> It is important to realize that once we have chosen the arbitrary element, we have added information to the forward process. So in the know-show table for this proposition, we added the statement, “Let <span class="process-math">\(x \in S\)</span>” to the forward process. Following is a completed proof of this proposition following the outline of the know-show table from <a href="S_provingset.html#PA_working2sets" class="internal" title="Beginning Activity: Beginning Activity 1: Working with Two Specific Sets">Beginning Activity 1</a>.</p>
