<p> Another way to define a sequence is to give a specific definition of the first term (or the first few terms) and then state, in general terms, how to determine <span class="process-math">\(a_{n + 1}\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and the first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> terms <span class="process-math">\(a_1 ,a_2 , \ldots ,a_n\text{.}\)</span> This process is known as <dfn class="terminology">definition by recursion</dfn> and is  also called a <dfn class="terminology">recursive definition</dfn>. The specific definition of the first term is called the <dfn class="terminology">initial condition</dfn>, and the general definition of <span class="process-math">\(a_{n + 1}\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and the first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> terms <span class="process-math">\(a_1 ,a_2 , \ldots ,a_n\)</span> is called the <dfn class="terminology">recurrence relation</dfn>. (When more than one term is defined explicitly, we say that these are the initial conditions.) For example, we can define a sequence recursively as follows: <blockquote class="blockquote">
<span class="process-math">\(b_1 = 16\text{,}\)</span> and for each <span class="process-math">\(n \in \mathbb{N}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b_{n + 1} = \dfrac{1}{2}b_n\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote></p>
