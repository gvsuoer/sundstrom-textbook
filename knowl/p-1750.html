<h4 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h4>
<p>In some other situations when we are trying to prove a proposition or a theorem about an element <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in some set <span class="process-math">\(U\text{,}\)</span> we often run into the problem that there does not seem to be enough information about <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to proceed. For example, consider the following proposition: <article class="assemblage assemblage-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Proposition 1.</span></h4>
<p>If <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is an integer, then <span class="process-math">\(\left( n^2 + n \right)\)</span> is an even integer.</p></article> If we were trying to write a direct proof of this proposition, the only thing we could assume is that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is an integer. This is not much help. In a situation such as this, we will sometimes use cases to provide additional assumptions for the forward process of the proof. Cases are usually based on some common properties that the element <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> may or may not possess. The cases must be chosen so that they exhaust all possibilities for the object <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in the hypothesis of the original proposition. For <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prop-ba34-2-even.html" title="Definition: Proposition 1">Proposition 1</a>, we know that an integer must be even or it must be odd. We can thus use the following two cases for the integer <span class="process-math">\(n\text{:}\)</span></p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The integer <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is an even integer;</p></li>
<li><p>The integer <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is an odd integer.</p></li>
</ul>
