<p>We will use a proof by contradiction. So we assume that there exist real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is rational, <span class="process-math">\(x \ne 0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is irrational, and <span class="process-math">\(x \cdot y\)</span> is rational. Since <span class="process-math">\(x \ne 0\text{,}\)</span> we can divide by <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> and since the rational numbers are closed under division by nonzero rational numbers, we know that <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{1}{x} \in \Q\text{.}\)</span> We now know that <span class="process-math">\(x \cdot y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{1}{x}\)</span> are rational numbers and since the rational numbers are closed under multiplication, we conclude that</p>
