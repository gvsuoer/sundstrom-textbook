<p>A proof by contradiction is often used to prove a conditional statement <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> when a direct proof has not been found and it is relatively easy to form the negation of the proposition. The advantage of a proof by contradiction is that we have an additional assumption with which to work (since we assume not only <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> but also <span class="process-math">\(\mynot Q\)</span>). The disadvantage is that there is no well-defined goal to work toward. The goal is simply to obtain some contradiction. There usually is no way of telling beforehand what that contradiction will be, so we have to stay alert for a possible absurdity. Thus, when we set up a know-show table for a proof by contradiction, we really only work with the know portion of the table.</p>
