<span class="heading"><span class="title">When is it indicated?</span></span><p>This type of proof is often used when both the hypothesis and the conclusion are stated in the form of negations. This often works well if the conclusion contains the operator “or”; that is, if the conclusion is in the form of a disjunction. In this case, the negation will be a conjunction.</p>

<span class="heading"><span class="title">Description of the process.</span></span><p>We prove the logically equivalent statement <span class="process-math">\(\mynot Q \to \mynot P\text{.}\)</span> The forward-backward method is used to prove <span class="process-math">\(\mynot Q \to \mynot P\text{.}\)</span> That is, we work forward from <span class="process-math">\(\mynot Q\)</span> and backward from <span class="process-math">\(\mynot P\text{.}\)</span></p>

<span class="heading"><span class="title">Why the process makes sense.</span></span><p>When we prove <span class="process-math">\(\mynot Q \to \mynot P\text{,}\)</span> we are also proving <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> because these two statements are logically equivalent. When we prove the contrapositive of <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\text{,}\)</span> we are doing a direct proof of <span class="process-math">\(\mynot Q \to \mynot P\text{.}\)</span> So we assume <span class="process-math">\(\mynot Q\)</span> because, when doing a direct proof, we assume the hypothesis, and <span class="process-math">\(\mynot Q\)</span> is the hypothesis of the contrapositive. We must show <span class="process-math">\(\mynot P\)</span> because it is the conclusion of the contrapositive.</p>
