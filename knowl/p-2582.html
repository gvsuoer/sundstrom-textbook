<p>Since we start with one adult pair, there will be one pair produced the first month, and since there is still only one adult pair, one pair will also be produced in the second month (since the new pair produced in the first month is not yet mature). In the third month, two pairs will be produced, one by the original pair and one by the pair which was produced in the first month. In the fourth month, three pairs will be produced, and in the fifth month, five pairs will be produced.</p>
