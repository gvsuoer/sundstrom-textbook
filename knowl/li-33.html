<p>Several sections of the text include exercises called Evaluation of Proofs. (The first such exercise appears in <a href="S_directproof.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.1: Direct Proofs">SectionÂ 3.1</a>) For these exercises, there is a proposed proof of a proposition. However, the proposition may be true or may be false. If a proposition is false, the proposed proof is, of course, incorrect, and the student is asked to find the error in the proof and then provide a counterexample showing that the proposition is false. However, if the proposition is true, the proof may be incorrect or not well written. In keeping with the emphasis on writing, students are then asked to correct the proof and/or provide a well-written proof according to the guidelines established in the book.</p>
<p>To assist students with studying the material in the text, there is a summary at the end of each chapter. The summaries usually list the important definitions introduced in the chapter and the important results proven in the chapter. If appropriate, the summary also describes the important proof techniques discussed in the chapter.</p>
<p>Answers or hints for several exercises are included in an appendix. This was done in response to suggestions from many students at Grand Valley and some students from other institutions who were using the book. </p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="fm-preface.html#li-33" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
