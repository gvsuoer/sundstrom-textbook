<p>Sometimes, we must be aware of conventions that are being used. In most calculus texts, the convention is that any function has a domain and a range that are subsets of the real numbers. In addition, when we say something like “the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>”, it is understood that <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is a real number. With these conventions, the following statement is a true statement, which is proven in many calculus texts. <blockquote class="blockquote">If the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> then the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous at <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> Using only this true statement, is it possible to make a conclusion about the function in each of the following cases?</p>
