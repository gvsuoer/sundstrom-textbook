<p>We have now seen two different infinite cardinal numbers, <span class="process-math">\(\aleph_0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\boldsymbol{c}\text{.}\)</span> It can seem surprising that there is more than one infinite cardinal number. A reasonable question at this point is, “Are there any other infinite cardinal numbers?” The astonishing answer is that there are, and in fact, there are infinitely many different infinite cardinal numbers. The basis for this fact is the following theorem, which states that a set is not equivalent to its power set. The proof is due to Georg Cantor (1845–1918), and the idea for this proof was explored in <a href="S_uncountablesets.html#PA_powerset" class="internal" title="Beginning Activity: Beginning Activity 2: Functions from a Set to Its Power Set">Beginning Activity 2</a>. The basic idea of the proof is to prove that any function from a set <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to its power set cannot be a surjection.</p>
