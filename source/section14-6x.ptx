          We assume that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are even integers and will prove that <m>x+y</m> is an even integer.
          Since <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are even,
          there exist integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> such that <m>x = 2m</m> and <m>y = 2n</m>.
          We can then conclude that
          <md>
            <mrow>x + y \amp = 2m + 2n</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 2(m + n)</mrow>

          Since the integers are closed under addition,
          <m>m + n</m> is an integer and the last equation shows that <m>x + y</m> is an even integer.
          This proves that if <m>x</m> is an even integer and <m>y</m> is an even integer,
          then <m>x + y</m> is an even integer.

      All examples should indicate the proposition is true.
      Following is a proof.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We assume that <m>m</m> is an odd integer and will prove that <m>\left( 3m^2 + 4m + 6 \right)</m> is an odd integer.
        Since <m>m</m> is an odd integer,
        there exists an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>m = 2k + 1</m>.
        Substituting this into the expression
        <m>\left( 3m^2 + 4m + 6 \right)</m> and using algebra,
        we obtain
        <md>
          <mrow>3m^2 + 4m + 6 \amp = 3\left(2k + 1 \right)^2 + 4 \left(2k + 1 \right) + 6</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = \left( 12k^2 + 12k + 3 \right) + \left( 8k + 4 \right) + 6</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 12k^2 + 20k + 13</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 12k^2 + 20k + 12 + 1</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 2 \left(6k^2 + 10k + 6 \right) + 1</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        By the closure properties of the integers,
        <m>\left(6k^2 + 10k + 6 \right)</m> is an integer, and hence,
        the last equation shows that <m>3m^2 + 4m + 6</m> is an odd integer.
        This proves that if <m>m</m> is an odd integer,
        then <m>\left( 3m^2 + 4m + 6 \right)</m> is an odd integer.
      </p>

    <proof>
      <p>
        We let <m>m</m> be a real number and assume that <m>m</m>,
        <m>m + 1</m>,
        and <m>m + 2</m> are the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle.
        We will use the Pythagorean Theorem to prove that <m>m = 3</m>.
        Since the hypotenuse is the longest of the three sides,
        the Pythagorean Theorem implies that <m>m^2 + (m + 1)^2 = (m + 2)^2</m>.
        We will now use algebra to rewrite both sides of this equation as follows:
        <md>
          <mrow>m^2 + \left( m^2 + 2m + 1 \right) \amp = m^2 + 4m + 4</mrow>
          <mrow>2m^2 + 2m + 1 \amp = m^2 + 4m + 4</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        The last equation is a quadratic equation.
        To solve for <m>m</m>,
        we rewrite the equation in standard form and then factor the left side.
        This gives
        <md>
          <mrow>m^2 - 2m - 3 \amp = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>(m - 3)(m + 1) \amp = 0</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        The two solutions of this equation are <m>m = 3</m> and <m>m = -1</m>.
        However, since <m>m</m> is the length of a side of a right triangle,
        <m>m</m> must be positive and we conclude that <m>m = 3</m>.
        This proves that if <m>m</m>, <m>m + 1</m>,
        and <m>m + 2</m> are the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle,
        then <m>m = 3</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
