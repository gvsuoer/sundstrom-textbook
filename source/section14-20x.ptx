      <m>A = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \text{  is a multiple of  9 }  \right\}</m> and <m>B = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid  x \text{  is a multiple of  3 }  \right\}</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            The set <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>B</m>.
            To prove this, we let <m>x \in A</m>.
            Then there exists an integer <m>m</m> such that <m>x = 9m</m>,
            which can be written as
            <me>
              x = 3 \left( 3m \right)\!
            </me>.
            Since <m>3m \in \Z</m>,
            the last equation proves that <m>x</m> is a multiple of 3 and so <m>x \in B</m>.
            Therefore, <m>A \subseteq B</m>.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            The set <m>A</m> is not equal to the set <m>B</m>.
            We note that <m>3 \in B</m> but <m>3 \notin A</m>.
            Therefore, <m>B \not \subseteq A</m> and, hence, <m>A \ne B</m>.

    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be subsets of some universal set.
        We will prove that <m>A - B = A \cap B^c</m> by proving that each set is a subset of the other set.
        We will first prove that <m>A - B \subseteq A \cap B^c</m>.
        Let <m>x \in A - B</m>.
        We then know that <m>x \in A</m> and <m>x \notin B</m>.
        However, <m>x \notin B</m> implies that <m>x \in B^c</m>.
        Hence, <m>x \in A</m> and <m>x \in B^c</m>,
        which means that <m>x \in A \cap B^c</m>.
        This proves that <m>A - B \subseteq A \cap B^c</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove that <m>A \cap B^c \subseteq A - B</m>,
        we let <m>y \in A \cap B^c</m>.
        This means that <m>y \in A</m> and <m>y \in B^c</m>, and hence,
        <m>y \in A</m> and <m>y \notin B</m>.
        Therefore, <m>y \in A - B</m> and this proves that <m>A \cap B^c \subseteq A - B</m>.
        Since we have proved that each set is a subset of the other set,
        we have proved that <m>A - B = A \cap B^c</m>.

    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>A = \{ x \in \Z \mid \mod{x}{3}{12} \}</m> and <m>B = \{ y \in \Z \mid \mod{y}{2}{8} \}</m>.
        We will use a proof by contradiction to prove that <m>A \cap B = \emptyset</m>.
        So we assume that <m>A \cap B \ne \emptyset</m> and let <m>x \in A \cap B</m>.
        We can then conclude that <m>\mod{x}{3}{12}</m> and that <m>\mod{x}{2}{8}</m>.
        This means that there exist integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> such that
        <me>
          x = 3 + 12m  \text{ and }   x = 2 + 8n
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By equating these two expressions for <m>x</m>,
        we obtain <m>3 + 12m = 2 + 8n</m>,
        and this equation can be rewritten as <m>1 = 8n - 12m</m>.
        This is a contradiction since 1 is an odd integer and <m>8n - 12m</m> is an even integer.
        We have therefore proved that <m>A \cap B = \emptyset</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
