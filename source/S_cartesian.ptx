      <title>An Equation with Two Variables</title>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="S_predicates"></xref>,
        we introduced the concept of the
        <term>truth set of an open sentence with one variable.</term>
            <idx><h>truth set</h></idx>
        This was defined to be the set of all elements in the universal set that can be substituted for the variable to make the open sentence a true statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In previous mathematics courses,
        we have also had experience with open sentences with two variables.
        For example,
        if we assume that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> represent real numbers,
        then the equation
        <me>
          2x + 3y = 12
        </me>
        is an open sentence with two variables.
        An element of the truth set of this open sentence
        (also called a solution of the equation)
        is an ordered pair <m>\left( {a,b} \right)</m> of real numbers so that when <m>a</m> is substituted for <m>x</m> and <m>b</m> is substituted for <m>y</m>,
        the open sentence becomes a true statement (a true equation in this case).
        For example,
        we see that the ordered pair <m>(6, 0)</m> is in the truth set for this open sentence since
        <me>
          2 \cdot 6 + 3 \cdot 0 = 12
        </me>
        is a true statement.
        On the other hand,
        the ordered pair <m>(4, 1)</m> is not in the truth set for this open sentence since
        <me>
          2 \cdot 4 + 3 \cdot 1 = 12
        </me>
        is a false statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <term>Important Note</term>: The order of the two numbers in the ordered pair is very important.
        We are using the convention that the first number is to be substituted for <m>x</m> and the second number is to be substituted for <m>y</m>.
        With this convention,
        <m>\left( 3, 2 \right)</m> is a solution of the equation <m>2x + 3y = 12</m>,
        but <m>\left( 2, 3 \right)</m> is not a solution of this equation.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              List six different elements of the truth set
              (often called the solution set)
              of the open sentence with two variables <m>2x + 3y = 12</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              From previous mathematics courses,
              we know that the graph of the equation <m>2x + 3y = 12</m> is a straight line.
              Sketch the graph of the equation
              <m>2x + 3y = 12</m> in the <m>xy</m>-coordinate plane.

        In <xref ref="PA_equationwith2vars"></xref>,
        we worked with ordered pairs without providing a formal definition of an ordered pair.
        We instead relied on your previous work with ordered pairs,
        primarily from graphing equations with two variables.
        Following is a formal definition of an ordered pair.

            This means that for two ordered pairs to be equal,
            they must contain exactly the same objects in the same order.
            That is, if <m>a, c \in A</m> and <m>b, d \in B</m>, then

  <subsection>
    <title>Cartesian Products</title>
    <p>
      When working with Cartesian products,
      it is important to remember that the Cartesian product of two sets is itself a set.
      As a set, it consists of a collection of elements.
      In this case,
      the elements of a Cartesian product are ordered pairs.
      We should think of an ordered pair as a single object that consists of two other objects in a specified order.
      For example,
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>a \ne 1</m>, then the ordered pair
            <m>\left( {1,a} \right)</m> is not equal to the ordered pair <m>\left( {a,1} \right)</m>.
            That is, <m>\left( {1,a} \right) \ne \left( {a,1} \right)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>A = \left\{ {1,2,3} \right\}</m> and <m>B = \left\{ {a,b} \right\}</m>,
            then the ordered pair <m>\left( {3,a} \right)</m> is an element of the set <m>A \times B</m>.
            That is, <m>\left( {3,a} \right) \in A \times B</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>A = \left\{ {1,2,3} \right\}</m> and <m>B = \left\{ {a,b} \right\}</m>,
            then the ordered pair <m>\left( {5,a} \right)</m> is not an element of the set
            <m>A \times B</m> since <m>5 \notin A</m>.
            That is, <m>\left( {5,a} \right) \notin A \times B</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="S_setproperties"></xref>,
      we studied certain properties of set union, set intersection,
      and set complements, which we called the algebra of sets.
      We will now begin something similar for Cartesian products.
      We begin by examining some specific examples in <xref ref="prog_relationscartesian"></xref>
      and a little later in <xref ref="prog_cartprodintervals"></xref>.

        <m>B = \left\{ {a,b} \right\}</m> , and <m>C = \left\{ {a,c} \right\}</m>.
        We can then form new sets from all of the set operations we have studied.
        For example, <m>B \cap C = \left\{ a \right\}</m>, and so
        <me>
          A \times \left( {B \cap C} \right) = \left\{ {\left( {1,a} \right),\left( {2,a} \right),\left( {3,a} \right)} \right\}

  <subsection xml:id="sym_cartplane">
    <title>The Cartesian Plane</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA_equationwith2vars"></xref>,
      we sketched the graph of the equation
      <m>2x + 3y = 12</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane.
      This <m>xy</m>-plane, with which you are familiar,
      is a representation of the set
      <m>\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m> or <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>.
      This plane is called the <em>Cartesian plane.</em>
          <idx><h>Cartesian plane</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic idea is that each ordered pair of real numbers corresponds to a point in the plane,
      and each point in the plane corresponds to an ordered pair of real numbers.
      This geometric representation of
      <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> is an extension of the geometric representation of
      <m>\mathbb{R}</m> as a straight line whose points correspond to real numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the Cartesian product
      <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> corresponds to the Cartesian plane,
      the Cartesian product of two subsets of
      <m>\mathbb{R}</m> corresponds to a subset of the Cartesian plane.
      For example,
      if <m>A</m> is the interval <m>\left[ {1,3} \right]</m>,
      and <m>B</m> is the interval <m>\left[ {2,5} \right]</m>, then
      <me>
        A \times B = \left\{ {\left( {x, y} \right) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid 1 \leq x \leq 3\text{ and } 2 \leq y \leq 5} \right\}\!
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A graph of the set <m>A \times B</m> can then be drawn in the Cartesian plane as shown in <xref ref="fig_cartprod"></xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_cartprod">
      <caption>Cartesian Product <m>A \times B</m></caption>
      <image width="73%" source="images/figps-cartprod.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This illustrates that the graph of a Cartesian product of two intervals of finite length in
      <m>\mathbb{R}</m> corresponds to the interior of a rectangle and possibly some or all of its boundary.
      The solid line for the boundary in <xref ref="fig_cartprod"></xref>
      indicates that the boundary is included.
      In this case,
      the Cartesian product contained all of the boundary of the rectangle.
      When the graph does not contain a portion of the boundary,
      we usually draw that portion of the boundary with a dotted line.
    </p>
    <p>
      \note <em>A Caution about Notation</em>.
      The standard notation for an open interval in
      <m>\mathbb{R}</m> is the same as the notation for an ordered pair,
      which is an element of \mbox{<m>\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m>} . We need to use the context in which the notation is used to determine which interpretation is intended.
      For example,
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If we write <m>\left( {\sqrt 2 ,7} \right) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m>,
            then we are using <m>\left( {\sqrt 2 ,7} \right)</m> to represent an ordered pair of real numbers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If we write  <m>\left( {1,2} \right) \times \left\{ 4 \right\}</m>,
            then we are interpreting  <m>\left( {1,2} \right)</m> as an open interval.
            We could write
            <me>
              \left( {1,2} \right) \times \left\{ 4 \right\} = \left\{ {\left. {\left( {x,4} \right)\,} \right|1 \lt  x \lt  2} \right\}\!
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The following progress check explores some of the same ideas explored in <xref ref="prog_relationscartesian"></xref>
      except that intervals of real numbers are used for the sets.

    </theorem>
    <p>
      We will not prove all these results;
      rather, we will prove <xref ref="T_propsofcartprod2"/> of <xref ref="T_propsofcartprod"></xref>
      and leave some of the rest to the exercises.
      In constructing these proofs,
      we need to keep in mind that Cartesian products are sets,
      and so we follow many of the same principles to prove set relationships that were introduced in <xref ref="S_provingset">Sections</xref>
      and <xref ref="S_setproperties"></xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other thing to remember is that the elements of a Cartesian product are ordered pairs.
      So when we start a proof of a result such as <xref ref="T_propsofcartprod2"/> of <xref ref="T_propsofcartprod"></xref>,
      the primary goal is to prove that the two sets are equal.
      We will do this by proving that each one is a subset of the other one.
      So if we want to prove that <m>A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right) \subseteq \left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right)</m>,
      we can start by choosing an arbitrary element of <m>A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right)</m>.
      The goal is then to show that this element must be in <m>\left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right)</m>.
      When we start by choosing an arbitrary element of <m>A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right)</m>,
      we could give that element a name.
      For example, we could start by letting
      <men xml:id="eq_cartprod">
        u \text{ be an element of }  A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right)\!
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can then use the definition of
      <q>ordered pair</q>
      to conclude that
      <men xml:id="eq_cartprod2">
        \text{ there exists }  x \in A  \text{ and there exists }  y \in B \cup C \text{ such that }   u = \left( {x,y} \right)
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to prove that <m>A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right) \subseteq \left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right)</m>,
      we must now show that the ordered pair <m>u</m> from<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_cartprod"/> is in <m>\left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right)</m>.
      In order to do this,
      we can use the definition of set union and prove that
      <men xml:id="eq_cartprod3">
        u \in (A \times B) \text{ or }  u \in (A \times C)
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>u = (x, y)</m>,
      we can prove<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_cartprod3"/> by proving that
      <men xml:id="eq_cartprod4">
        \left( x \in A \text{ and }  y \in B \right) \text{ or }  \left( x \in A \text{ and }  y \in C \right)
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we look at the sentences in<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_cartprod2"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_cartprod4"/>,
      it would seem that we are very close to proving that <m>A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right) \subseteq \left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right)</m>.
      Following is a proof of <xref ref="T_propsofcartprod2"/> of <xref ref="T_propsofcartprod"></xref>.

    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> be sets.
        We will prove that <m>A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right)</m> is equal to
        <m>\left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right)</m> by proving that each set is a subset of the other set.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove that <m>A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right) \subseteq \left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right)</m>,
        we let <m>u \in A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right)</m>.
        Then there exists <m>x \in A</m> and there exists
        <m>y \in B \cup C</m> such that <m>u = \left( {x,y} \right)</m>.
        Since <m>y \in B \cup C</m>, we know that <m>y \in B</m> or <m>y \in C</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case where <m>y \in B</m>,
        we have <m>u = \left( {x,y} \right)</m>,
        where <m>x \in A</m> and <m>y \in B</m>.
        So in this case, <m>u \in A \times B</m>,
        and hence <m>u \in \left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right)</m>.
        Similarly, in the case where <m>y \in C</m>,
        we have <m>u = \left( {x,y} \right)</m>,
        where <m>x \in A</m> and <m>y \in C</m>.
        So in this case, <m>u \in A \times C</m> and, hence,
        <m>u \in \left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In both cases,
        <m>u \in \left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right)</m>.
        Hence, we may conclude that if <m>u</m> is an element of <m>A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right)</m>,
        then <m>u \in \left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right)</m>,
        and this proves that
        <men xml:id="eq_4m">
          A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right) \subseteq \left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right)\!
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must now prove that <m>\left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right) \subseteq A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right)</m>.
        So we let <m>v \in \left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right)</m>.
        Then <m>v \in \left( {A \times B} \right)</m> or <m>v \in \left( {A \times C} \right)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case where <m>v \in \left( {A \times B} \right)</m>,
        we know that there exists <m>s \in A</m> and there exists <m>t \in B</m> such that <m>v = \left( {s,\;t} \right)</m>.
        But since <m>t \in B</m>,
        we know that <m>t \in B \cup C</m>,
        and hence <m>v \in A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right)</m>.
        Similarly, in the case where <m>v \in \left( {A \times C} \right)</m>,
        we know that there exists <m>s \in A</m> and there exists <m>t \in C</m> such that <m>v = \left( {s,t} \right)</m>.
        But because <m>t \in C</m>,
        we can conclude that <m>t \in B \cup C</m> and,
        hence, <m>v \in A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In both cases, <m>v \in A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right)</m>.
        Hence, we may conclude that if
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>v \in \left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right)</m>,
        then <m>v \in A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right)</m>, and this proves that
        <men xml:id="eq_4n">
          \left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right) \subseteq A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right)\!

      </p>
      <p>
        The relationships in<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_4m"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_4n"/> prove that <m>A \times \left( {B \cup C} \right) = \left( {A \times B} \right) \cup \left( {A \times C} \right)</m>.

      The definition of an ordered pair in <xref ref="prev54-cartesian"></xref>
      may have seemed like a lengthy definition,
      but in some areas of mathematics,
      an even more formal and precise definition of

      is needed.
      This definition is explored in <xref ref="exer_defoforderedpair"/>.

          (<em>A Set Theoretic Definition of an Ordered Pair</em>) In elementary mathematics,
          the notion of an ordered pair introduced at the beginning of this section will suffice.
          However, if we are interested in a formal development of the Cartesian product of two sets,
          we need a more precise definition of ordered pair.
          Following is one way to do this in terms of sets.
          This definition is credited to Kazimierz Kuratowski (1896 <mdash/> 1980).
    <idx><h>Kuratowski, Kazimierz</h></idx>
Kuratowski was a famous Polish mathematician whose main work was in the areas of topology and set theory.
          He was appointed the Director of the Polish Academy of Sciences and served in that position for 19 years.
          Let  <m>x</m>  be an element of the set  <m>A</m>,
          and let  <m>y</m>  be an element of the set  <m>B</m>.
          The <em>ordered pair</em>
    <idx><h>ordered pair</h></idx>
          <m>\left( {x,y} \right)</m> is defined to be the set <m>\left\{ {\left\{ x \right\},\left\{ {x,y} \right\}} \right\}</m>.
          That is,
          <me>
            \left( {x,y} \right) = \left\{ {\left\{ x \right\},\left\{ {x,y} \right\}} \right\}\!
          </me>.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Explain how this definition allows us to distinguish between the ordered pairs
                <m>\left( {3,5} \right)</m> and <m>\left( {5,3} \right)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets and let
                <m>a,c \in A</m> and <m>b,d \in B</m>.
                Use this definition of an ordered pair and the concept of set equality to prove that
                <m>\left( {a,b} \right) = \left( {c,d} \right)</m> if and only if <m>a = c</m> and <m>b = d</m>.
              </p>

          </ol>
        </p>
        An <em>ordered triple</em>
    <idx><h>ordered triple</h></idx>
can be thought of as a single triple of objects,
denoted by  <m>\left( {a,b,c} \right)</m>,
with an implied order.  This means that in order for two ordered triples to be equal,
they must contain exactly the same objects in the same order.  That is,
<m>\left( {a,b,c} \right) = \left( {p,q,r} \right)</m> if and only if  <m>a = p</m>,
<m>b = q</m> and <m>c = r</m>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> be sets,
              and let <m>x \in A,y \in B,\text{ and } z \in C</m>.
              Write a set theoretic definition of the ordered triple
              <m>\left( {x,y,z} \right)</m> similar to the set theoretic definition of
              <q>ordered pair.</q>
