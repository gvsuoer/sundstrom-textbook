        Dodge Ball is a game for two players.
        It is played on a game board such as the one shown in <xref ref="fig_dodgeball">Figure</xref>.

      <p>
        Player One has a 6 by 6 array to complete and Player Two has a 1 by 6 row to complete.
        Each player has six turns as described next.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Player One begins by filling in the first horizontal row of his or her table with a sequence of six X's and O's, one in each square in the first row.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Then Player Two places either an X or an O in the first box of his or her row.
              At this point, Player One has completed the first row and Player Two has filled in the first box of his or her row with one letter.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The game continues with Player One completing a row with six letters (X's and O's),
              one in each box of the next row followed by Player Two writing one letter
              (an X or an O)
              in the next box of his or her row.
              The game is completed when Player One has completed all six rows and Player Two has completed all six boxes in his or her row.

        <term>Winning the Game</term>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Player One wins if any horizontal row in the 6 by 6 array is identical to the row that Player Two created.
              (Player One matches Player Two.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Player Two wins if Player Two's row of six letters is different than each of the six rows produced by Player One.
              (Player Two
              <q>dodges</q>
              Player One.)

        There is a winning strategy for one of the two players.
        This means that there is plan by which one of the two players will always win.
        Which player has a winning strategy?
        Carefully describe this winning strategy.

        <term>Applying the Winning Strategy to Lists of Real Numbers</term>
      </p>
      <p>
        Following is a list of real numbers between 0 and 1.
        Each real number is written as a decimal number.
        <md>
          <mrow>a_1 \amp = 0.1234567890   \amp   a_6 \amp = 0.0103492222</mrow>

        Use a method similar to the winning strategy in the game of Dodge Ball to write a real number
        (in decimal form)
        between 0 and 1 that is not in this list of 10 numbers.
        <ol>

            <p>
              Do you think your method could be used for any list of 10 real numbers between 0 and 1 if the goal is to write a real number between 0 and 1 that is not in the list?

      We have seen examples of sets that are countably infinite,
      but we have not yet seen an example of an infinite set that is uncountable.
      We will do so in this section.
      The first example of an uncountable set will be the open interval of real numbers <m>( 0, 1 )</m>.
      The proof that this interval is uncountable uses a method similar to the winning strategy for Player Two in the game of Dodge Ball from <xref ref="PA_dodgeball"></xref>.
      Before considering the proof,
      we need to state an important result about decimal expressions for real numbers.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Decimal Expressions for Real Numbers</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>decimal expression</h><h>for a real number</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      In its decimal form, any real number <m>a</m> in the interval
      <m>( 0, 1 )</m> can be written as <m>a = 0.a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 \ldots </m>,
      where each <m>a_i</m> is an integer with <m>0 \leq a_i \leq 9</m>.
      For example,
      <me>
        \frac{5}{12} = 0.416666 \ldots
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We often abbreviate this as
      <m>\dfrac{5}{12} = 0.41 \overline{6}</m> to indicate that the <m>6</m> is repeated.
      We can also repeat a block of digits.
      For example,
      <m>\dfrac{5}{26} = 0.19 \overline{230769}</m> to indicate that the block 230769 repeats.
      That is,
      <me>
        \frac{5}{26} = 0.19230769230769230769 \ldots
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is only one situation in which a real number can be represented as a decimal in more than one way.
      A decimal that ends with an infinite string of 9's is equal to one that ends with an infinite string of 0's.
      For example,
      <m>0.3199999 \ldots</m> represents the same real number as <m>0.3200000 \ldots </m>.
      Geometric series can be used to prove that a decimal that ends with an infinite string of 9's is equal to one that ends with an infinite string of 0's, but we will not do so here.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="normalized">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A decimal representation of a real number <m>a</m> is in
          <term>normalized form</term>
          <idx><h>decimal expression</h><h>normalized form</h></idx>
              <idx><h>normalized form</h><h>of a decimal expression</h></idx>
          provided that there is no natural number <m>k</m> such that for all natural numbers <m>n</m> with <m>n > k</m>,
          <m>a_n = 9</m>.
          That is, the decimal representation of <m>a</m> is in normalized form if and only if it does not end with an infinite string of 9's.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      One reason the normalized form is important is the following theorem
      (which will not be proved here).
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_normalized">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Two decimal numbers in normalized form are equal if and only if they have identical digits in each decimal position.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="sym_continuum">
    <title>Uncountable Subsets of <m>\boldsymbol{\mathbb{R}}</m></title>
    <p>
      In the proof that follows,
      we will use only the normalized form for the decimal representation of a real number in the interval <m>( 0, 1 )</m>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_uncountableinterval">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The open interval <m>( 0, 1 )</m> is an uncountable set.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Since the interval <m>( 0, 1 )</m> contains the infinite subset <m>\left\{\dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{1}{3}, \dfrac{1}{4}, \ldots \,\right\}</m>,
        we can use <xref ref="T_subsetisinfinite">Theorem</xref>,
        to conclude that <m>( 0, 1 )</m> is an infinite set.
        So <m>( 0, 1 )</m> is either countably infinite or uncountable.
        We will prove that <m>( 0, 1 )</m> is uncountable by proving that any function from <m>\N</m> to <m>(0, 1)</m> is not a surjection,
        and hence,
        there is no bijection from <m>\N</m> to <m>(0, 1)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So suppose that <m>f\x \mathbb{N} \to ( 0, 1 )</m> is a function.
        We will show that <m>f</m> is not a surjection by showing that there exists an element in
        <m>( 0, 1 )</m> that cannot be in the range of <m>f</m>.
        Writing the images of the elements of
        <m>\mathbb{N}</m> in normalized form, we can write
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}f ( 1 ) \amp = 0.a_{1 1} a_{1 2} a_{1 3} a_{1 4} a_{1 5} \ldots \\ f ( 2 ) \amp = 0.a_{2 1} a_{2 2} a_{2 3} a_{2 4} a_{2 5} \ldots \\ f ( 3 ) \amp = 0.a_{3 1} a_{3 2} a_{3 3} a_{3 4} a_{3 5} \ldots \\ f ( 4 ) \amp = 0.a_{4 1} a_{4 2} a_{4 3} a_{4 4} a_{4 5} \ldots \\ f ( 5 ) \amp = 0.a_{5 1} a_{5 2} a_{5 3} a_{5 4} a_{5 5} \ldots \\ \amp  \vdots \\ f ( n ) \amp = 0.a_{n 1} a_{n 2} a_{n 3} a_{n 4} a_{n 5} \ldots \\ \amp  \vdots \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice the use of the double subscripts.
        The number <m>a_{i j}</m> is the
        <m>j^\text{ th }</m> digit to the right of the decimal point in the normalized decimal representation of <m>f ( i )</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will now construct a real number <m>b = 0.b_1 b_2 b_3 b_4 b_5 \ldots</m> in
        <m>( 0, 1 )</m> and in normalized form that is not in this list.

        \note The idea is to start in the upper left corner and move down the diagonal in a manner similar to the winning strategy for Player Two in the game in <xref ref="PA_dodgeball"></xref>.
        At each step,
        we choose a digit that is not equal to the diagonal digit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start with <m>a_{1 1}</m> in <m>f ( 1 )</m>.
        We want to choose <m>b_1</m> so that <m>b_1 \ne 0</m>,
        <m>b_1 \ne a_{1 1}</m>, and <m>b_1 \ne 9</m>.
        (To ensure that we end up with a decimal that is in normalized form,
        we make sure that each digit is not equal to 9.)
        We then repeat this process with <m>a_{2 2}</m>,
        <m>a_{3 3}</m>, <m>a_{4 4}</m>,
        <m>a_{5 5}</m>, and so on.
        So we let <m>b</m> be the real number <m>b = 0.b_1 b_2 b_3 b_4 b_5 \ldots </m>,
        where for each <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>
        <men>
          b_k = \begin{cases}3         \amp \text{if \(a_{k k} \ne 3\)}  \\ 5         \amp \text{if \(a_{k k} = 3\).} \end{cases}
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        (The choice of 3 and 5 is arbitrary.
        Other choices of distinct digits will also work.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Now for each <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
        <m>b \ne f ( n )</m> since <m>b</m> and <m>f ( n )</m> are in normalized form and <m>b</m> and <m>f ( n )</m> differ in the <m>n</m>{th} decimal place.
        Therefore, <m>f</m> is not a surjection.
        This proves that any function from <m>\mathbb{N}</m> to
        <m>( 0, 1 )</m> is not a surjection and hence,
        there is no bijection from <m>\mathbb{N}</m> to <m>( 0, 1 )</m>.
        Therefore, <m>( 0, 1 )</m> is not countably infinite and hence must be an uncountable set.

    <title>Cantor's Theorem</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>Cantor's Theorem</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now seen two different infinite cardinal numbers,
      <m>\aleph_0</m> and <m>\boldsymbol{c}</m>.
      It can seem surprising that there is more than one infinite cardinal number.
      A reasonable question at this point is,
      <q>Are there any other infinite cardinal numbers?</q>
      The astonishing answer is that there are, and in fact,
      there are infinitely many different infinite cardinal numbers.
      The basis for this fact is the following theorem,
      which states that a set is not equivalent to its power set.
      The proof is due to Georg Cantor (1845<ndash/>1918),
          <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx>
      and the idea for this proof was explored in <xref ref="PA_powerset"></xref>.
      The basic idea of the proof is to prove that any function from a set <m>A</m> to its power set cannot be a surjection.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_cantor">
      <title>Cantor's Theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For every set <m>A</m>, <m>A</m> and
          <m>\mathcal{P} ( A )</m> do not have the same cardinality.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a set.
        If <m>A = \emptyset</m>,
        then <m>\mathcal{P} ( A ) = \left\{ \emptyset \right\}</m>,
        which has cardinality 1.
        Therefore, <m>\emptyset</m> and
        <m>\mathcal{P} ( \emptyset )</m> do not have the same cardinality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now suppose that <m>A \ne \emptyset</m>,
        and let <m>f\x  A \to \mathcal{P} ( A )</m>.
        We will show that <m>f</m> cannot be a surjection,
        and hence there is no bijection from <m>A</m> to <m>\mathcal{P} ( A )</m>.
        This will prove that <m>A</m> is not equivalent to <m>\mathcal{P} ( A )</m>.
        Define
        <me>
          S = \left\{ x \in A \mid x \notin f ( x ) \right\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assume that there exists a <m>t</m> in <m>A</m> such that <m>f ( t ) = S</m>.
        Now, either <m>t \in S</m> or <m>t \notin S</m>.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>t \in S</m>,
              then <m>t \in \left\{ x \in A \mid x \notin f ( x ) \right\}</m>.
              By the definition of <m>S</m>,
              this means that <m>t \notin f ( t )</m>.
              However, <m>f ( t ) = S</m> and so we conclude that <m>t \notin S</m>.
              But now we have <m>t \in S</m> and <m>t \notin S</m>.
              This is a contradiction.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>t \notin S</m>,
              then <m>t \notin \left\{ x \in A \mid x \notin f ( x ) \right\}</m>.
              By the definition of <m>S</m>,
              this means that <m>t \in f ( t )</m>.
              However, <m>f ( t ) = S</m> and so we conclude that <m>t \in S</m>.
              But now we have <m>t \notin S</m> and <m>t \in S</m>.
              This is a contradiction.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        So in both cases we have arrived at a contradiction.
        This means that there does not exist a <m>t</m> in <m>A</m> such that <m>f ( t ) = S</m>.
        Therefore, any function from <m>A</m> to
        <m>\mathcal{P} ( A )</m> is not a surjection and hence not a bijection.
        Hence, <m>A</m> and <m>\mathcal{P} ( A )</m> do not have the same cardinality.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <corollary xml:id="C_cantor">
      <statement>

      </statement>
    </corollary>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>\mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} )</m> contains the infinite subset <m>\left\{ \left\{ 1 \right\}, \left\{ 2 \right\}, \left\{ 3 \right\} \ldots \,\right\}</m>,
        we can use <xref ref="T_subsetisinfinite">Theorem</xref>,
        to conclude that <m>\mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} )</m> is an infinite set.
        By Cantor's Theorem
        (<xref ref="T_cantor">Theorem</xref>),
        <m>\mathbb{N}</m> and <m>\mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} )</m> do not have the same cardinality.
        Therefore, <m>\mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} )</m> is not countable and hence is an uncountable set.

    <ol>
      <li xml:id="sec94_comment1">
        <p>
          We have now seen that any open interval of real numbers is uncountable and has cardinality <m>\boldsymbol{c}</m>.
          In addition,
          <m>\mathbb{R}</m> is uncountable and has cardinality <m>\boldsymbol{c}</m>.
          Now, <xref ref="C_cantor">Corollary</xref>
          tells us that <m>\mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} )</m> is uncountable.
          A question that can be asked is,
          <q>Does <m>\mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} )</m> have the same cardinality as <m>\mathbb{R}</m>?</q>
          The answer is yes, although we are not in a position to prove it yet.
          A proof of this fact uses the following theorem,
          which is known as the Cantor-Schr&#xf6;der-Bernstein Theorem.

          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets.

      In the statement of this theorem,
      notice that it is not required that the function <m>g</m> be the inverse of the function <m>f</m>.
      We will not prove the Cantor-Schr&#xf6;der-Bernstein Theorem here.
      The following items will show some uses of this important theorem.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The Cantor-Schr&#xf6;der-Bernstein Theorem can also be used to prove that the closed interval
            <m>[ 0, 1 ]</m> is equivalent to the open interval <m>( 0, 1 )</m>.
            See Exercise<nbsp/><xref ref="exer_closedinterval"/> on <xref ref="exer_closedinterval">page</xref>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Another question that was posed earlier is,
            <q>Are there other infinite cardinal numbers other than
            <m>\aleph_0</m> and <m>\boldsymbol{c}</m>?</q>
            Again, the answer is yes, and the basis for this is Cantor's Theorem
            (<xref ref="T_cantor">Theorem</xref>).
            We can start with <m>\text{ card } ( \mathbb{N} ) = \aleph_0</m>.
            We then define the following infinite cardinal numbers:
            <ul>
              \item <m>\text{ card } ( \mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} ) ) = \alpha_1</m>. \item <m>\text{ card } ( \mathcal{P} ( \mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} ) ) ) = \alpha_2</m>. \item <m>\text{ card } ( \mathcal{P} ( \mathcal{P} ( \mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} ) ) ) ) = \alpha_3</m>. \item <m>\vdots</m>
            </ul>
          </p>
          Cantor's Theorem tells us that these are all different cardinal numbers,
          and so we are just using the lowercase Greek letter <m>\alpha</m> (alpha) to help give names to these cardinal numbers.
          In fact, although we will not define it here, there is a way to
          <q>order</q>
          these cardinal numbers in such a way that
          <me>
            \aleph_0 \lt  \alpha_1 \lt  \alpha_2 \lt  \alpha_3 \lt  \cdots
          </me>.
          Keep in mind, however,
          that even though these are different cardinal numbers, Cantor's Theorem does not tell us that these are the only cardinal numbers.

        <li>
          <p>
            In Comment<nbsp/><xref ref="sec94_comment1"/>,
            we indicated that <m>\mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} )</m> and
            <m>\mathbb{R}</m> have the same cardinality.
            Combining this with the notation in Comment<nbsp/><xref ref="sec94_comment3"/>, this means that
            <me>
              \alpha_1 = \boldsymbol{c}
            </me>.
            However, this does not necessarily mean that <m>\boldsymbol{c}</m> is the
            <q>next largest</q>
            cardinal number after <m>\aleph_0</m>.
            A reasonable question is,
            <q>Is there an infinite set with cardinality between
            <m>\aleph_0</m> and <m>\boldsymbol{c}</m>?</q>
            Rewording this in terms of the real number line, the question is,
            <q>On the real number line,
            is there an infinite set of points that is not equivalent to the entire line and also not equivalent to the set of natural numbers?</q>
            This question was asked by Cantor,
            but he was unable to find any such set.
            He conjectured that no such set exists.
            That is, he conjectured that
            <m>\boldsymbol{c}</m> is really the next cardinal number after <m>\aleph_0</m>.
            This conjecture has come to be known as the
            <em>Continuum Hypothesis</em>.
              <idx><h>Continuum Hypothesis</h></idx>
          Stated somewhat more formally,
            the Continuum Hypothesis is There is no set <m>X</m> such that <m>\aleph_0 \lt  \text{ card }  ( X ) \lt  \boldsymbol{c}</m>.
            The question of whether the Continuum Hypothesis is true or false is one of the most famous problems in modern mathematics.
            Through the combined work of Kurt G&#xf6;del
              <idx><h>G&#xf6;del, Kurt</h></idx>
            in the 1930s and Paul Cohen
              <idx><h>Cohen, Paul</h></idx>
            in 1963, it has been proved that the Continuum Hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved from the standard axioms of set theory.
            This means that either the Continuum Hypothesis or its negation can be added to the standard axioms of set theory without creating a contradiction.

          In Exercise<nbsp/><xref ref="exer_irrationaluncount"/>,
          we showed that the set of irrational numbers is uncountable.
          However, we still do not know the cardinality of the set of irrational numbers.
          Notice that we can use <m>\Q^c</m> to stand for the set of irrational numbers.

        We know that any real number <m>a</m> can be represented in decimal form as follows:
        <me>
          a = A.a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 \cdots a_n \cdots
        </me>,
        where <m>A</m> is an integer and the decimal part
        <m>( 0.a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 \cdots )</m> is in normalized form.
        (See <xref ref="normalizedform">page</xref>.)
        We also know that the real number <m>a</m> is an irrational number if and only <m>a</m> has an infinite non-repeating decimal expansion.
        We now associate with <m>a</m> the real number

          A.a_1 0 a_2 1 1 a_3 0 0 0 a_4 1 1 1 1 a_5 0 0 0 0 0 a_6 1 1 1 1 1 1 \cdots
        </men>.
        Notice that to construct the real number in <xref ref="exer_irrationalsuncount"/>,
        we started with the decimal expansion of <m>a</m>,
        inserted a 0 to the right of the first digit after the decimal point,
        inserted two 1's to the right of the second digit to the right of the decimal point,
        inserted three 0's to the right of the third digit to the right of the decimal point,
        and so on.
