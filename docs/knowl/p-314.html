<p>Definitions play a very important role in mathematics. A direct proof of a proposition in mathematics is often a demonstration that the proposition follows logically from certain definitions and previously proven propositions. A <dfn class="terminology">definition</dfn> is an agreement that a particular word or phrase will stand for some object, property, or other concept that we expect to refer to often. In many elementary proofs, the answer to the question, “How do we prove a certain proposition?”, is often answered by means of a definition. For example, in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/pr_explores.html" title="Progress Check 1.2: Explorations">Progress Check 1.2</a>, all of the examples should have indicated that the following conditional statement is true: <blockquote class="blockquote">If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are odd integers, then <span class="process-math">\(x \cdot y\)</span> is an odd integer.</blockquote> In order to construct a mathematical proof of this conditional statement, we need a precise definition of what it means to say that an integer is an even integer and what it means to say that an integer is an odd integer.</p>
